Inhibits vasopressin binding human V2R in the nanomolar range (Ki=5.02 nM), and also potently inhibits vasopressin-induced cAMP production (IC(50)=94 nM) (PubMed:35122240). In vivo, this protein shows an aquaretic effect (PubMed:28630289, PubMed:35122240). Urine output increases and urine osmolality decreases dramatically under treatment with this protein, without differences observed between healthy mice and the pcy mice model of the autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (PubMed:28630289). This protein does not modify electrolyte, protein and urea excretions in the urine samples, but produces a 3-fold decrease of creatinine levels (PubMed:28630289). Intraperitoneal injection of this protein into the pcy mice significantly reduces the number of renal cysts and the total area of cysts (PubMed:28630289).

Is highly visible in mice liver and kidney after intravenous injection (PubMed:33052234). Is rapidly eliminated in the liver, whereas it exhibits slow elimination in the kidney due to the high expression of V2R which acts as a reservoir (PubMed:33052234).

In addition, it shows the same effects described for the heterodimer and binds the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR chloride channels and increases the channel current (By similarity).

This toxin suppress Nav1.7 current amplitude without significantly altering the activation, inactivation, and repriming kinetics. Short extreme depolarizations partially activate the toxin-bound channel, indicating voltage-dependent inhibition of this toxin. This toxin increases the deactivation of the Nav1.7 current after extreme depolarizations. The toxin-Nav1.7 complex is gradually dissociated upon prolonged strong depolarizations in a voltage-dependent manner, and the unbound toxin rebinds to Nav1.7 after a long repolarization. Moreover, analysis of chimeric channels showed that the DIIS3-S4 linker is critical for toxin binding to Nav1.7. These data are consistent with this toxin interacting with Nav1.7 site 4 and trapping the domain II voltage sensor in the closed state. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23703613}."

Also displays cytotoxic activity against some cell lines, and antimicrobial activities against E.coli, C.albicans and Leishmania (PubMed:18602430). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (PubMed:24145104). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (PubMed:24145104). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (PubMed:24145104). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (PubMed:24145104). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (PubMed:24145104). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18602430, ECO:0000305|PubMed:24145104}."

CA has no PLA2 activity and is not neurotoxic by itself, but plays several important functions in the crotoxin complex by increasing the lethal potency of the uncomplexed CB subunit. It acts by physically occluding the hydrophobic interfacial binding surface (IBS) of CB (PubMed:21787789, PubMed:21787789). This effect decreases the adsorption of CB to phospholipid membranes, targeting the crotoxin complex to reach the specific presynaptic receptor (R48) at the neuromuscular junction. It also prevents the formation of the reactive CB dimer. Moreover, the CA subunit inhibits the catalytic activity by partially masking the catalytic site of CB (PubMed:21787789) and inhibits its anticoagulant activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21787789}.; FUNCTION: Heterodimer CA-CB: Crotoxin is a potent presynaptic neurotoxin that possesses phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and exerts a lethal action by blocking neuromuscular transmission. It consists of a non-covalent association of a basic and weakly toxic PLA2 subunit (CBa2, CBb, CBc, or CBd), with a small acidic, non-enzymatic and non-toxic subunit (CA1, CA2, CA3 or CA4). The complex acts by binding to a specific 48-kDa protein (R48/CAPT) receptor located on presynaptic membranes, forming a transient ternary complex CA-CB-R48, followed by dissociation of the CA-CB complex and release of the CA subunit (PubMed:12657321). At equilibrium, only the CB subunits remain associated with the specific crotoxin receptor. In addition to neurotoxicity, crotoxin has been found to exert myotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cardiovascular toxicity (PubMed:20109480). Moreover, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-tumor and analgesic effects of crotoxin have also been reported (PubMed:20109480). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12657321, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20109480}.; FUNCTION: [Crotoxin chain gamma]: Found in the venom as a monomer and stabilized by one disulfide bond (Cys-131 and Cys-138) (PubMed:18495297).

The released ATP amplifies the effect of the myotoxins, acting as a 'danger signal', which spreads and causes further damage by acting on purinergic receptors (PubMed:20660736). A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18062812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1899180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20660736, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2781572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7886694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9654096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9839670, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9920486}."

It inhibits Nav1.7/SCN9A activation by interacting with DII and impairs Nav1.7/SCN9A inactivation by interacting with DIV (PubMed:20855463). It docks on top of the DII S3 helix Nav1.7/SCN9A (PubMed:30661758, PubMed:30765606).

This toxin binds to lipid membrane (PubMed:15632158, PubMed:27311819). This ability correlates with hNav1.7/SCN9A inhibition, showing that membrane binding is the first step in the inhibitory mechanism of this toxin (PubMed:27311819). It inhibits Nav1.2/SCN2A less potently when it is coexpressed with SCN2B or SCN4B than when it is expressed alone, showing that beta subunits (SCN2B and SCN4B) have a protective effect (PubMed:24297919, PubMed:26894959). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12475222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15632158, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17087985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17339321, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18156314, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18657562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18728100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20855463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24886690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25658507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26894959, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27311819, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30765606}."

This suggests a kinetic mechanism model with two different states of toxin-channel binding (T+C=TC*=TC; in the TC* state, the toxin binds the channel but does not occlude the pore, whereas in the TC state the toxin binds and occludes the pore). In this model, incomplete block is explained by the relatively fast dissociation rate from the blocked channel conformation (TC) relative to the rate of conversion of the toxin-channel encounter complex (TC*) to the blocked channel conformation (TC) (PubMed:17369411). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10224238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11755529, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11864985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12860380, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497878, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17369411, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20600425}."

It acts as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), and as a potent voltage-gated potassium channel inhibitor. It exhibits antimicrobial activities, hind limb paralysis, and severe muscle necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. As a cell-penetrating peptide, crotamine has high specificity for actively proliferating cells, and interacts inside the cell with subcellular and subnuclear structures, like vesicular compartments, chromosomes and centrioles. It penetrates into the cells as fast as five minutes after its addition to cell culture medium (PubMed:18662711). In vivo, after intraperitoneal administration, it is found in cells of peritoneal fluid and bone marrow, demonstrating preferential nuclear and perinuclear localization. To enter the cell, it interacts with the chains of heparan sulfate membrane proteoglycan (HSPG), and is endocytosed (in complex with HSPG) in vesicles which are transported into the cell with the help of clathrin. Inside the cell, crotamine accumulates in lysosomal vesicles. As soon as the peptide accumulates in endosomes/lysosomes vesicles, these compartments are disrupted and their contents released into the cytosol. This loss of lysosomal content induces cell death at high concentrations, or promotes the distribution of crotamine in cytoplasmic compartments, which is a step before crotamine nuclear uptake (PubMed:15231729, PubMed:17491023). As a potassium channel inhibitor, this toxin selectively inhibits Kv1.1/KCNA1, Kv1.2/KCNA2 and Kv1.3/KCNA3 channels with an IC(50) of 369, 386 and 287 nM, respectively (PubMed:22498659). The inhibition of Kv1.3/KCNA channels induced by this toxin occurs rapidly and is voltage-independent. The channel inhibition is reversible after washing, suggesting a pure and classical channel blockage effect, without effects in potassium channel kinetics (PubMed:22498659). As an antimicrobial peptide, crotamine shows antibacterial activity against E.coli and B.subtilis, and antifungal activity against Candida spp., Trichosporon spp. and C.neoformans.

According to Deuis and colleagues, shows a preferential activity on Nav1.7/SCN9A (Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=0.9-4.4 nM)) (PubMed:28106092). Another study shows a much less potent activity on Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=1457 nM) (PubMed:31234412). Also shows potent to moderate effects on hNav1.1/SCN1A (IC(50)=37 nM), hNav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=124 nM), hNav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=210 nM), hNav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=144 nM), hNav1.5/SCN5A (IC(50)=800 nM), hNav1.6/SCN8A (IC(50)=129 nM), hNav1.9/SCN11A (IC(50)=2427 nM) (PubMed:28106092). On Nav1.7/SCN9A, the toxin acts by shifting the voltage-dependence of activation to more depolarized potentials, whereas it does not cause significant effect on the voltage-dependence of activation on other sodium channels (PubMed:28106092). Minor effects are observed on the voltage-dependence of steady-state fast inactivation for all sodium channels tested (Nav1.1/SCN1A-Nav1.7/SCN9A) (PubMed:28106092). Shows a specific interaction with the S3-S4 linkers in DII and DIV domains of Nav1.7/SCN9A (PubMed:28106092). Also shows inhibitory activity on calcium channels (PubMed:35858123). Rat DRG neuron high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents (ICa) are inhibited by 55% by high concentration (10 uM) of this toxin (PubMed:35858123). In addition, mCav1.2, rCav1.3, hCav2.1, and hCav2.2 channels are reversibly inhibited (60-80% inhibition by 10 uM of toxin) (PubMed:35858123). The toxin inhibits hCav2.2 (IC(50)=3.71 uM) by inducing a hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation, without apparent changes in channel activation (PubMed:33584315). The toxin also inhibits Cav3.3/CACNA1I channels, but it modifies its gating through a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation thus decreasing hCav3.3-mediated currents (IC(50)=960 nM) (PubMed:35858123). May also stabilize the closed/resting state of Cav3.3 (PubMed:35858123). Recovers 1.5-fold faster from inactivation, compared to control (PubMed:35858123). Shows a specific interaction to the S3-S4 region of DII domain voltage sensor of Cav3.3/CACNA1I (PubMed:35858123). In vivo, when tested on a mouse model of pain induced by Nav1.7 activation, the toxin dose-dependently reduces pain behavior (PubMed:28106092). In addition, in rodent pain models, co-administration of the toxin with sub-therapeutic doses of opioids results in significant analgesia/anti-allodynia, arguing for synergistic analgesic effects (PubMed:28106092, PubMed:31335646). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28106092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31234412, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31335646, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33584315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35858123}."

According to Goncalves et al., 2019, it shows a similar inhibition on almost all sodium channels tested (Nav1.1/SCN1A (IC(50)=280.3 nM), Nav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=73.7 nM), Nav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=201.5 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)>2100 nM), Nav1.5/SCN5A (IC(50)=710.6 nM), Nav1.6/SCN8A (IC(50)=491.2 nM), and Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=254.3-260 nM)), except Nav1.8/SCN10A (PubMed:31443554). The voltage-dependence of steady-state Nav1.7/SCN9A channel activation and inactivation are not affected, suggesting that is does not act as a gating-modifier toxin but rather blocks or impedes ion flux through the channel pore (Ref.1, PubMed:31234412).

It binds voltage-dependently to sodium channels (Nav), inhibits the inactivation of the activated channels and decreases the peak inward current (PubMed:19231838, PubMed:26119670). The toxin delays inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A, Nav1.3/SCN3A, Nav1.4/SCN4A and Nav1.8/SCN10A, slows the inactivation process and decreases the sodium peak amplitude of Nav1.5/SCN5A and Nav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:26119670). In vivo, it enhances erectile function by inducing the release of nictric oxide (NO): it slows the sodium current, leading to depolarization, which leads to an increase in calcium influx (probably via activation of N-type calcium channels) which in turn activates neuronal NO synthase (nNOS/NOS1), inducing nitric oxide (NO) production (PubMed:20722794, PubMed:21975567). In a final step, NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (GUCY1A1/GUCY1B1) which in turn increases cGMP formation, resulting in penile erection (PubMed:23583324). It is noteworthy that the toxin does not provoke erection by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5A), an enzyme that hydrolysis cGMP (PubMed:23583324). In vivo, it also causes scratching, lacrimation, hypersalivation, sweating and agitation followed by spastic paralysis of the anterior and posterior extremities and death at dose levels of 0.79 mg/mouse (PubMed:1397265, PubMed:16278100). It is insecticidal to the larval and adult forms of the house fly (PubMed:1397265).

Does not inhibit inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A when the channel is coexpressed with the beta-1 auxiliary subunit (PubMed:30076230).

A model of myotoxic mechanism has been proposed: an apo Lys49-PLA2 is activated by the entrance of a hydrophobic molecule (e.g. fatty acid) at the hydrophobic channel of the protein leading to a reorientation of a monomer (By similarity). This reorientation causes a transition between 'inactive' to 'active' states, causing alignment of C-terminal and membrane-docking sites (MDoS) side-by-side and putting the membrane-disruption sites (MDiS) in the same plane, exposed to solvent and in a symmetric position for both monomers (By similarity). The MDoS region stabilizes the toxin on membrane by the interaction of charged residues with phospholipid head groups (By similarity). Subsequently, the MDiS region destabilizes the membrane with penetration of hydrophobic residues (By similarity). This insertion causes a disorganization of the membrane, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. calcium and sodium), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:I6L8L6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11594738}."

This toxin acts by binding to and stabilizing the closed state of the channel, thereby impeding the transition into a conducting state (PubMed:28320941). This toxin may bind to the acidic pocket of ASIC1a, since mutation of a key residue of this pocket (Arg-350) abolishes the ability of the toxin to inhibit ASIC1a (PubMed:28320941).

It acts as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent proton sensitivity for inactivation. It binds more tightly to the closed state and to a much lesser extent the inactivated/desensitized state of ASIC1a (By similarity). It interacts directly with the outside surface of the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1a (ASIC1a), but does not insert into the acidic pocket as suggested previously (By similarity). This binding leads to relocation of the thumb domain that could disrupt the acidic pocket of cASIC1a (By similarity). The peptide exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on ASIC1a (By similarity). It reversibly inhibits rASIC1a (IC(50)=17 nM), rASIC1b (IC(50)= 44 nM) and rASIC1a-rASIC2a (IC(50)=252 nM) channels (Ref.1). In vivo, it shows a potent naloxone-resistant analgesic effect against acute and inflammatory pain upon central and peripheral injection. In addition, it also has an opioid-independent effect on both thermal and mechanical inflammatory pain after systemic administration and is effective against neuropathic pain (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P0DKR6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P0DKS3, ECO:0000269|Ref.1}."

Minor effects are observed on the voltage-dependence of steady-state fast inactivation for all sodium channels tested (Nav1.1/SCN1A-Nav1.8/SCN10A). By testing the toxin on channel chimera, it has been shown to interact with the S3-S4 linkers in DII and DIV domains of Nav1.7/SCN9A. In vivo, the toxin dose-dependently reduces OD1-induced spontaneous pain behaviors. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P0DM12}."

Self-association of melittin in membranes is promoted by high ionic strength, but not by the presence of negatively charged lipids. In vivo, intradermal injection into healthy human volunteers produce sharp pain sensation and an inflammatory response.

Increases GABA release and inhibits GABA uptake in synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex (PubMed:28621878). May acts on GABA transporters, since its action on GABA uptake and GABA release is not altered by the presence of calcium, sodium and potassium channel blockers (PubMed:28621878). May also modulate GABA(A) receptors, since it significantly decreases GABA-binding in synaptic membranes from rat brain cortex (PubMed:28621878). In addition, decreases SLC6A1- and SLC6A11-mediated GABA uptake in transfected COS-7 cells, in uncompetitive and mixed inhibition modes, respectively (PubMed:28621878). It is noteworthy that the inhibition of GABA uptake could be an indirect result of an increased GABA release (PubMed:28621878). In vivo, microinjections of this toxin into the nigral area of rodents brains attenuates panic attack-like responses elicited by GABAergic disinhibition in the dorsal midbrain with intramesencephalic administration of bicuculline (PubMed:15621014). Based on these results, authors suggest that this toxin may be acting as an agonist of GABA(A) receptors in the ventral mesencephalon (PubMed:15621014). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15621014, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28621878}."

Its activity on Gram-negative bacteria is contreversial, since Li and colleagues (2014) describe no activity towards E.coli and P.aeruginosa, while Kim and colleagues (2018) describe a potent activity towards P.aeruginosa (MIC=3.13-12.5 uM) (PubMed:24826994, PubMed:29379033).

  TITLE     micro-Theraphotoxin Pn3a inhibition of CaV3.3 channels reveals a
            novel isoform-selective drug binding site","[FUNCTION] Gating-modifier toxin that targets both voltage-gated
            sodium and calcium channels, with described activities on
            hNav1.1/SCN1A, hNav1.2/SCN2A, hNav1.3/SCN3A, hNav1.4/SCN4A,
            hNav1.5/SCN5A, hNav1.6/SCN8A, h/m/r Nav1.7/SCN9A, hNav1.9/SCN11A,
            hCav1.2/CACNA1C, hCav1.3/CACNA1D, hCav2.1/CACNA1A and
            hCav2.2/CACNA1B channels (PubMed:28106092, PubMed:31234412,
            PubMed:33584315, PubMed:35858123). According to Deuis and
            colleagues, shows a preferential activity on Nav1.7/SCN9A
            (Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=0.9-4.4 nM)) (PubMed:28106092). Another study
            shows a much less potent activity on Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=1457 nM)
            (PubMed:31234412). Also shows potent to moderate effects on
            hNav1.1/SCN1A (IC(50)=37 nM), hNav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=124 nM),
            hNav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=210 nM), hNav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=144 nM),
            hNav1.5/SCN5A (IC(50)=800 nM), hNav1.6/SCN8A (IC(50)=129 nM),
            hNav1.9/SCN11A (IC(50)=2427 nM) (PubMed:28106092). On Nav1.7/SCN9A,
            the toxin acts by shifting the voltage-dependence of activation to
            more depolarized potentials, whereas it does not cause significant
            effect on the voltage-dependence of activation on other sodium
            channels (PubMed:28106092). Minor effects are observed on the
            voltage-dependence of steady-state fast inactivation for all sodium
            channels tested (Nav1.1/SCN1A-Nav1.7/SCN9A) (PubMed:28106092).
            Shows a specific interaction with the S3-S4 linkers in DII and DIV
            domains of Nav1.7/SCN9A (PubMed:28106092). Also shows inhibitory
            activity on calcium channels (PubMed:35858123). Rat DRG neuron high
            voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents (ICa) are inhibited by 55%
            by high concentration (10 uM) of this toxin (PubMed:35858123). In
            addition, mCav1.2, rCav1.3, hCav2.1, and hCav2.2 channels are
            reversibly inhibited (60-80% inhibition by 10 uM of toxin)
            (PubMed:35858123). The toxin inhibits hCav2.2 (IC(50)=3.71 uM) by
            inducing a hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation,
            without apparent changes in channel activation (PubMed:33584315).
            The toxin also inhibits Cav3.3/CACNA1I channels, but it modifies
            its gating through a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence
            of activation thus decreasing hCav3.3-mediated currents (IC(50)=960
            nM) (PubMed:35858123). May also stabilize the closed/resting state
            of Cav3.3 (PubMed:35858123). Recovers 1.5-fold faster from
            inactivation, compared to control (PubMed:35858123). Shows a
            specific interaction to the S3-S4 region of DII domain voltage
            sensor of Cav3.3/CACNA1I (PubMed:35858123). In vivo, when tested on
            a mouse model of pain induced by Nav1.7 activation, the toxin
            dose-dependently reduces pain behavior (PubMed:28106092). In
            addition, in rodent pain models, co-administration of the toxin
            with sub-therapeutic doses of opioids results in significant
            analgesia/anti-allodynia, arguing for synergistic analgesic effects
            (PubMed:28106092, PubMed:31335646). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28106092,

            development of novel analgesic agents. When injected with an opioid
            analgesic drug, it provides an enhanced and effective therapeutic
            approach to the treatment and/or prevention of pain
            (PubMed:28106092, PubMed:31335646, PubMed:33584315). May be used to

            difference K36L (FKIGGFIKKLWRSLLA) (PubMed:27207743). Both peptides
            display distinct anticancer modes of action (PubMed:27207743).
            ZXR-1 could translocate into cells, target on the mitochondria and
            induce cell apoptosis, while ZXR-2 directly targets on the cell
            membranes and causes membrane lysis (PubMed:27207743). The variance

            [FUNCTION] This lethal neurotoxin (without cyclization at position
            53) inhibits neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2/SCN2A
            (IC(50)=10-150 nM), rNav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=338 nM), Nav1.6/SCN8A
            (IC(50)=117 nM), and hNav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=9.6-33 nM)
            (PubMed:18628201, PubMed:20855463, PubMed:25658507,
            PubMed:29703751, PubMed:31234412, PubMed:23760503). It inhibits
            activation of sodium channel by trapping the voltage sensor of
            domain II (DIIS4) in the closed configuration (PubMed:18628201,
            PubMed:23760503). The toxin neither shifts the Nav1.7/SCN9A
            activation curve nor modifies the slope factor (PubMed:20855463).
            It does not slow fast-inactivation of hNav1.7/SCN9A channels
            (PubMed:20855463). In addition, it has only a weak affinity for
            lipid membranes (PubMed:18054060, PubMed:29703751,
            PubMed:28115115). This toxin also exists with a pyroglutamate at
            position 53 (PubMed:23826086). The sole difference observed between
            modified (mHwTx-IV) and unmodified toxins is that moderate or high
            depolarization voltages (200 mV) permit the unmodified toxin to
            dissociate, whereas mHwTx-IV toxin does not dissociate, even at
            high depolarization voltages (PubMed:23826086). These data indicate
            that mHwTx-IV strongly binds to voltage sensor of sodium channel
            even at extreme depolarization voltages (PubMed:23826086).

            [PTM] Two forms of huwentoxin-IV exist in the venom of H.schmidti,
            a non-N-terminally modified (HwTx-IV) and a naturally modified
            peptide with pyroglutamic acid residue at position 53 (mHwTx-IV).
            mHwTx-IV shows no observable difference with the unmodified toxin
            when applied to the TTX-S sodium channel of DRG neuron (IC(50)

            (PubMed:23826086, PubMed:28115115). In addition, similarly to the
            unmodified toxin, mHwTx-IV has only a weak affinity for lipid
            membranes (PubMed:28115115). However, in contrast with HwTx-IV,
            which dissociates at moderate and high depolarization voltages
            (50-200 mV), mHwTx-IV inhibition of TTX-sensitive sodium channels

            as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton
            sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent
            proton sensitivity for inactivation (PubMed:23034652). It binds
            more tightly to the closed state and to a much lesser extent the
            inactivated/desensitized state of ASIC1a isoform of ASIC1
            (PubMed:23034652). It interacts directly with the outside surface
            of the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1a (ASIC1a), but does not insert
            into the acidic pocket as suggested for mambalgin-2
            (PubMed:29872539). This binding leads to relocation of the thumb
            domain that could disrupt the acidic pocket of cASIC1a
            (PubMed:29872539). It reversibly inhibits rat ASIC1a (IC(50)=3.4-55

            and peripheral injection (PubMed:23034652). In addition, it also

            [FUNCTION] This peptide both inhibits the activity of the
            angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and enhances the action of
            bradykinin by inhibiting the peptidases that inactivate it. It acts
            as an indirect hypotensive agent. Bradykinin-potentiating peptide
            10b-F has much lower activity than the full-length peptide.

            [FUNCTION] Antimicrobial and mast cell degranulating peptide that
            interacts with lipid bilayers and activates G-protein coupled
            receptors (PubMed:3129426, PubMed:2117607, PubMed:30613778). Shows
            antimicrobial activity against some Gram-positive bacteria
            (S.aureus MIC=5 uM), Gram-negative bacteria (E.coli (MIC=50 uM),
            S.enterica), and fungi (B.cinerea (MIC=8 uM), C.albicans (MIC=25
            uM), C.albicans, C.glabrata, and C.neoformans) (PubMed:21184791,
            PubMed:27104500). Does not show antimicrobial activity against
            Gram-positive S.mutans (PubMed:27104500). Shows cytolytic activity
            against insect cell lines, as well as cytotoxicity against murine
            fibroblasts (L929), murine macrophages monocytes (RAW 264.7), and
            human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (PubMed:21184791,
            PubMed:33046640). Has also mast cell degranulation activity
            (PubMed:540362, PubMed:30613778). It functions by activating
            connective tissue mast cells via the MRGPRX2 G-protein coupled
            receptors (PubMed:30613778). Also stimulates nucleoside diphosphate
            kinases (NDPK) in many cell types, and indirectly stimulates
            G-protein coupled receptors through interaction with NDPK
            (PubMed:1338595, PubMed:7998971, PubMed:8573186). Also shows
            hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (PubMed:21184791,
            PubMed:33046640). Interacts with membranes and may be able to
            switch from an in-plane to a transmembrane orientation in lipid
            bilayers (PubMed:11168364). Has anxiolytic properties that can be
            explained by its ability to stimulate monoamine exocytosis and
            reduce plasma corticosterone (PubMed:3129426, PubMed:32059939). In
            docking studies, it also shows high affinity for GABA(A), 5-HT1A
            (HTR1A), corticotropin-releasing factor receptor subtype 1 (CRHR1)
            and glucocorticoid receptors (NR3C1), suggesting the involvement of
            GABAergic, serotonergic and glucocorticoid mechanisms in its
            anxiolytic-like properties (PubMed:32059939). In vivo, when tested
            on a mouse dermonecrotic S.aureus infection model, topical
            treatment with this peptide enhances clearance of S.aureus and
            accelerates healing of dermonecrotic lesions (PubMed:30613778). In
            vivo, oral and intracerebroventricular administration into mice
            induces anxiolytic-like effects (PubMed:32059939). In vivo, peptide
            injection in the vicinity of the head and thorax of lepidopteran
            larvae induces feeding disorder followed by death due to starvation
            (PubMed:21184791). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11168364,

            to produce an anti-cocaine vaccine to induce an immune response
            that could attenuate the effects of cocaine consumption in humans

            of high-quality neutralizing antibodies, reduces cocaine
            penetration of the blood-brain barrier and protects mice from its
            psychoactive effects (PubMed:32047657). It is noteworthy that this

            cardiovascular processes such as blood pressure. Venom of
            Meiacanthus fangblennies shows a potent hypotensive bioactivity
            (tested on M.grammistes), but has no effect on the heart rate.

            tested on mammals. While species-specific nociceptive effects are
            possible, this defensive venom is surprisingly multifunctional,
            being markedly hypotensive (via neuropeptide Y and/ or
            enkephalins), weakly neurotoxic (unknown components, possibly
            PLA2s), and perhaps also pro-inflammatory (PLA2s and/or
            enkephalins). The pronounced hypotensive effects induced by venom
            peptides seem highly likely to affect the coordination and/or swim
            performance of envenomed fishes and therefore likely confer a
            fitness advantage to the fangblenny by facilitating escape from
            predators. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28366739}.

            [FUNCTION] This cationic hydrophobic peptide acts on a lot of
            different channels and has an antimicrobial activity. It blocks
            mechanosensitive ion channels (also named stretch-activated
            channels or SACs), without having effect on whole-cell
            voltage-sensitive currents. It also affects acetylcholine receptors
            (nAChRs) through interactions with membrane lipids by prolonging
            the closing time without affecting channel conductance or opening
            activity (PubMed:34374321). It shows high affinity for lipid
            bilayers (PubMed:15241420, PubMed:29703751). It acts by
            partitioning into the membrane and perturbing the interface between
            the channel and the lipid bilayer without necessarily being in
            physical contact with the channel. It inhibits atrial fibrillation
            as well as the membrane motor of outer hair cells at low doses. It
            also binds to the voltage sensor of voltage-gated potassium
            channels from the archaebacterium Aeropyrum pernix (KvAP) without
            affecting channel gating. It shows also a low inhibition on a large
            spectra of sodium channels (Nav1.1/SCN1A, Nav1.2/SCN2A,
            Nav1.3/SCN3A, Nav1.4/SCN4A, Nav1.5/SCN5A, Nav1.6/SCN8A,

            [FUNCTION] Mu-conotoxin KIIIA-P1: mu-conotoxins block voltage-gated
            sodium channels (Nav). This toxin potently blocks Nav1.2/SCN2A
            (IC(50)5-124 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=20-90 nM), and Nav1.7/SCN9A
            (IC(50)=290-413 nM) (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:19221510,
            PubMed:21781281, PubMed:21709136, PubMed:21652775, PubMed:23146020,
            PubMed:25658507, PubMed:35167877). It moderately blocks
            Nav1.1/SCN1A, and mNav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:21781281,
            PubMed:21709136, PubMed:21652775, PubMed:23146020, PubMed:25658507,
            PubMed:35167877). It also shows a very low activity on Nav1.3/SCN3A
            (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:21781281). This toxin binds a microsite
            within the pore different from the tetrodotoxin binding site 1
            (tested on Nav1.2) (PubMed:19221510). The block is partial, with a
            residual current that can be completely blocked by TTX
            (PubMed:19221510). The toxin probably docks at a more superficial
            site in the outer vestibule of the channel than does TTX
            (PubMed:19221510). On rNav1.2/SCN2A, it produces a block that is
            only partially reversible. The block of Nav1.7 is modified when
            beta-subunits are coexpressed with the alpha subunit
            (PubMed:23146020). Hence, blocks of channels containing beta-1 and
            beta-3 subunits are more potent (compared to channels without beta
            subunits), whereas blocks of channels containing beta-2 and beta-4
            subunits are less potent (compared to channels without beta
            subunits) (PubMed:23146020). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15882064,

            fraction of the non-neuronal cells (PubMed:25464369). In vivo, when

            unable to move, and at very low doses, it causes hyperactivity

            intradermal cheek injection into humanized transgenic mouse (mouse
            MRGPRX1 replaced by human MRGPRX1) induces scratching
            (PubMed:30243794). In vivo, when tested at high doses (10 uM) on
            zebrafish larvae, it induces a range of behavioral effects ranging
            from an early hypoactivity during the first hour of treatment to an
            increase in movement during the following hours when the larvae are
