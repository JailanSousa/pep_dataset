            ASIC3 homotrimers and heterotrimers containing ASIC3 (composed with

            PubMed:21943094, PubMed:22972919, PubMed:25337890). On homomeric
            ASIC3, this protein shows IC(50)=57-87 nM on rat, 37.3 nM on mouse
            and 175 nM on human channels (PubMed:15044953, PubMed:18923424,

            inhibits 38% of Kv3.4 current) (PubMed:15044953). It reversibly and
            voltage-dependently inhibits hKv11.1/KCNH2/ERG1 potassium channels
            (IC(50)=1.21 uM), inhibiting both peak and tail currents without

            [FUNCTION] This lethal neurotoxin (without cyclization at position
            53) inhibits neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2/SCN2A
            (IC(50)=10-150 nM), rNav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=338 nM), Nav1.6/SCN8A
            (IC(50)=117 nM), and hNav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=9.6-33 nM)
            (PubMed:18628201, PubMed:20855463, PubMed:25658507,
            PubMed:29703751, PubMed:31234412, PubMed:23760503). It inhibits
            activation of sodium channel by trapping the voltage sensor of
            domain II (DIIS4) in the closed configuration (PubMed:18628201,
            PubMed:23760503). The toxin neither shifts the Nav1.7/SCN9A
            activation curve nor modifies the slope factor (PubMed:20855463).
            It does not slow fast-inactivation of hNav1.7/SCN9A channels
            (PubMed:20855463). In addition, it has only a weak affinity for
            lipid membranes (PubMed:18054060, PubMed:29703751,
            PubMed:28115115). This toxin also exists with a pyroglutamate at
            position 53 (PubMed:23826086). The sole difference observed between
            modified (mHwTx-IV) and unmodified toxins is that moderate or high
            depolarization voltages (200 mV) permit the unmodified toxin to
            dissociate, whereas mHwTx-IV toxin does not dissociate, even at
            high depolarization voltages (PubMed:23826086). These data indicate
            that mHwTx-IV strongly binds to voltage sensor of sodium channel
            even at extreme depolarization voltages (PubMed:23826086).

            peptide with pyroglutamic acid residue at position 53 (mHwTx-IV).
            mHwTx-IV shows no observable difference with the unmodified toxin
            when applied to the TTX-S sodium channel of DRG neuron (IC(50)

            (PubMed:23826086, PubMed:28115115). In addition, similarly to the
            unmodified toxin, mHwTx-IV has only a weak affinity for lipid
            membranes (PubMed:28115115). However, in contrast with HwTx-IV,

  TITLE     Structure of the acid-sensing ion channel 1 in complex with the

            an inhibitor on ASIC1a (ASIC isoform 2) and a potentiator on ASIC1b
            (ASIC isoform 3) (PubMed:10829030, PubMed:15955877,
            PubMed:21036899). This toxin potently and selectively inhibits rat,
            mouse and human ASIC1a (IC(50)=0.35-3.7 nM) (PubMed:10829030,
            PubMed:15955877, PubMed:21715637, PubMed:26248594,
            PubMed:21825095). The blockade is rapidly reversible
            (PubMed:10829030, PubMed:28320941). The toxin acts by shifting its
            steady-state desensitization to more alkaline pH (0.27 pH unit)
            (PubMed:15955877, PubMed:16505147). At higher concentrations, it
            potentiates rat and human ASIC1b and activates chicken ASIC1 by
            stabilizing the open state of these subtypes (PubMed:16505147,
            PubMed:21036899, PubMed:19185346, PubMed:24262969,
            PubMed:22842900). The toxin binds most tightly to the open and the
            desensitized states of ASIC1a (promoting desensitization), whereas
            it binds most tightly to the open state of ASIC1b (promoting
            opening) (PubMed:16505147). The toxin also inhibits mouse
            ASIC1a-ASIC2b (IC(50)=2.64 nM) and rat ASIC1a-ASIC2a
            (PubMed:21715637, PubMed:27277303). It binds to the extracellular
            domain at subunit interfaces in the acidic pocket with the majority
            of contacts on the thumb domain of the channel (PubMed:21825095,
            PubMed:22842900, PubMed:22760635). It is also noteworthy that
            calcium competes with the toxin, probably by inhibiting binding of
            the toxin to the channel (PubMed:15955877).

  TITLE     Cryo-EM structure of the ASIC1a-mambalgin-1 complex reveals that
            the peptide toxin mambalgin-1 inhibits acid-sensing ion channels
            through an unusual allosteric effect","[FUNCTION] This three-finger toxin inhibits ASIC channels. It acts
            as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton
            sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent
            proton sensitivity for inactivation (PubMed:23034652). It binds
            more tightly to the closed state and to a much lesser extent the
            inactivated/desensitized state of ASIC1a isoform of ASIC1
            (PubMed:23034652). It interacts directly with the outside surface
            of the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1a (ASIC1a), but does not insert
            into the acidic pocket as suggested for mambalgin-2
            (PubMed:29872539). This binding leads to relocation of the thumb
            domain that could disrupt the acidic pocket of cASIC1a
            (PubMed:29872539). It reversibly inhibits rat ASIC1a (IC(50)=3.4-55
            nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC2b (IC(50)=61 nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC1b (IC(50)=72
            nM), human ASIC1a (IC(50)=127-580 nM), chicken ASIC1a (IC(50)=123.6
            nM), rat ASIC1b (IC(50)=22.2-203 nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC2a
            (IC(50)=152-252 nM) (PubMed:23034652, PubMed:23624383,

            PubMed:29872539). In vivo, it shows a potent naloxone-resistant
            analgesic effect against acute and inflammatory pain upon central
            and peripheral injection (PubMed:23034652). In addition, it also
            has an opioid-independent effect on both thermal and mechanical
            inflammatory pain after systemic administration and is effective
            against neuropathic pain (PubMed:26680001).

            body myositis (IBM) a rare disease with no approved treatment
            options and generally poor prognosis for the patients. The
            dalazatide development program is focused on providing a
            breakthrough treatment first for IBM and then followed by other
            rare and autoimmune diseases. ShK-186 contains an L-phosphotyrosine
            attached via an aeea (mini-PEG) hydrophilic linker to Arg-1 and is
            amidated. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19122005,

            [FUNCTION] Forms a proton-selective ion channel that is necessary
            for the efficient release of the viral genome during virus entry.
            After attaching to the cell surface, the virion enters the cell by
            endocytosis. Acidification of the endosome triggers M2 ion channel
            activity. The influx of protons into virion interior is believed to
            disrupt interactions between the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP),
            matrix protein 1 (M1), and lipid bilayers, thereby freeing the
            viral genome from interaction with viral proteins and enabling RNA
            segments to migrate to the host cell nucleus, where influenza virus
            RNA transcription and replication occur. Also plays a role in viral
            proteins secretory pathway. Elevates the intravesicular pH of
            normally acidic compartments, such as trans-Golgi network,
            preventing newly formed hemagglutinin from premature switching to
            the fusion-active conformation. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04069}.

            [FUNCTION] Reversibly inhibits the activity of ATP2A2 in cardiac
            sarcoplasmic reticulum by decreasing the apparent affinity of the
            ATPase for Ca(2+) (PubMed:28890335). Modulates the contractility of
            the heart muscle in response to physiological stimuli via its
            effects on ATP2A2. Modulates calcium re-uptake during muscle
            relaxation and plays an important role in calcium homeostasis in
            the heart muscle. The degree of ATP2A2 inhibition depends on the
            oligomeric state of PLN. ATP2A2 inhibition is alleviated by PLN
            phosphorylation. Controls intracellular Ca(2+) levels in elongated
            spermatids. May play a role in germ cell differentiation (By
            similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P61014,

  TITLE     Chemical synthesis, 3D structure, and ASIC binding site of the
            toxin mambalgin-2","[FUNCTION] This three-finger toxin inhibits ASIC channels. It acts
            as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton
            sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent
            proton sensitivity for inactivation (PubMed:24695733). It binds
            more tightly to the closed state and to a much lesser extent the
            inactivated/desensitized state of ASIC1a isoform of ASIC1
            (PubMed:24695733). It interacts directly with the outside surface
            of the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1a (ASIC1a), but does not insert
            into the acidic pocket as suggested previously (By similarity).
            This binding leads to relocation of the thumb domain that could
            disrupt the acidic pocket of cASIC1a (By similarity). The peptide
            exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on ASIC1a
            (PubMed:24695733). It reversibly inhibits rat ASIC1a (IC(50)=21-55
            nM), rat ASIC1b (IC(50)=103-192 nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC1b (IC(50)=72
            nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC2a (IC(50)=246-252 nM) and rat ASIC1a-ASIC2b
            (IC(50)=61 nM) (PubMed:23034652, PubMed:23624383, PubMed:24323786,
            PubMed:24695733, PubMed:26991634). In vivo, it shows a potent
            naloxone-resistant analgesic effect against acute and inflammatory
            pain upon central and peripheral injection (By similarity). In
            addition, it also has an opioid-independent effect on both thermal
            and mechanical inflammatory pain after systemic administration and
            is effective against neuropathic pain (By similarity).

            regulates the activation and inactivation of the voltage-gated

            (PubMed:25240294). It inhibits the sodium conductance (IC(50)=124
            nM) and slows the fast inactivation (EC(50)=1180 nM) of
            Nav1.5/SCN5A (PubMed:17176080, PubMed:25240294). It significantly
            shifts the activation to more depolarized voltages and decreases
            the deactivation of Nav1.5 currents upon extreme depolarization,
            but only slightly affects voltage-dependence of steady-state
            inactivation (PubMed:17176080, PubMed:25240294). In addition, this
            toxin causes an approximately five-fold decrease in the rate of
            recovery from inactivation and an approximately 1.9-fold reduction
            in the closed-state inactivation rate (PubMed:25240294). This toxin
            integrates the functions of site 3 toxins (alpha-scorpion toxins)
            with site 4 toxins (beta-scorpion and spider toxins) by targeting
            multiple sites on Nav1.5 (PubMed:25240294). Also shows inhibition
            of voltage-gated potassium channels (5 uM completely inhibits
            Kv2.1/KCNB1, whereas 5 uM moderately inhibits Kv4.2/KCND2
            Kv4.1/KCND1 channels) (PubMed:17176080).

            amplitude without significantly altering the activation,
            inactivation, and repriming kinetics. Short extreme depolarizations
            partially activate the toxin-bound channel, indicating
            voltage-dependent inhibition of this toxin. This toxin increases
            the deactivation of the Nav1.7 current after extreme
            depolarizations. The toxin-Nav1.7 complex is gradually dissociated
            upon prolonged strong depolarizations in a voltage-dependent
            manner, and the unbound toxin rebinds to Nav1.7 after a long
            repolarization. Moreover, analysis of chimeric channels showed that
            the DIIS3-S4 linker is critical for toxin binding to Nav1.7. These
            data are consistent with this toxin interacting with Nav1.7 site 4
            and trapping the domain II voltage sensor in the closed state.

            voltage-dependent inhibition of this toxin. This toxin increases
            the deactivation of the Nav1.7 current after extreme
            depolarizations. The toxin-Nav1.7 complex is gradually dissociated
            upon prolonged strong depolarizations in a voltage-dependent
            manner, and the unbound toxin rebinds to Nav1.7 after a long
            repolarization. Moreover, analysis of chimeric channels showed that
            the DIIS3-S4 linker is critical for toxin binding to Nav1.7. These
            data are consistent with this toxin interacting with Nav1.7 site 4
            and trapping the domain II voltage sensor in the closed state.

            [FUNCTION] Small multifunctional phosphoprotein involved in virion
            morphogenesis, egress and counteracting host innate immunity
            (PubMed:19339479, PubMed:21068219, PubMed:28096411,
            PubMed:30532200). Plays critical roles in the final steps of viral
            release by interacting with host TSG101, a member of the vacuolar
            protein-sorting pathway and using other cellular host proteins
            involved in vesicle formation pathway (PubMed:19339479,
            PubMed:21068219). Acts also as a viroporin and forms ion conductive
            pores allowing viral particle release (PubMed:28096411). Impairs
            the generation of type I interferon by down-regulating host TLR3
            and TLR7 as well as their downstream signaling pathways
            (PubMed:27270888, PubMed:29872132). Down-regulates the
            phosphorylation of host IRF3 via the interaction with host
            SIRP-alpha, thereby inhibiting IFN-I expression (PubMed:26492885).
            Interacts with host microtubules (PubMed:19369329).

            AMBP/bikunin and AMBP/alpha-1-microglobulin peptides. Interacts
            with host HPX/hemopexin. Interacts (when phosphorylated) with
            capsid protein ORF2 (By similarity). Interacts with host TSG101;
            this interaction plays a role in viral release from the host cell
            (PubMed:30068652, PubMed:21068219). Interacts with host SIRPA; this

            (PubMed:29567943). Potently inhibits inactivation of insect sodium
            channels of B.germanica (BgNav1) (EC(50)=8.6 nM), D.melanogaster
            (DmNav1), and arachnid sodium channel V.destructor (VdNav1)
            (PubMed:29567943, PubMed:34445875). Also delays the inactivation of
            most mammalian Nav channels tested (hNav1.1/SCN1A; EC(50)=124.1 nM,
            rNav1.2/SCN2A; EC(50)=359.6 nM, rNav1.3/SCN3A; EC(50)=135.4 nM,

            (PubMed:29567943, PubMed:34445875). 1 uM is enough to completely
            inhibits the inactivation, resulting in sustained non-inactivating
            currents (PubMed:29567943). In addition, the toxin significantly
            enhances the recovery from inactivation, and the open state is not
            required for the toxin to interact with the channel
            (PubMed:29567943). In vivo, injection into green crabs (Carcinus
            maenas at 1 mug/kg) of small doses (1-5 ug/kg) results in slow and
            fast permanent paralysis, whereas injection of high doses (more
            than 10 ug/kg) causes death (PubMed:29567943). Injection into
            juvenile Blaptica dubia cockroaches results in death or permanent
            paralysis at doses higher than 7.1 ug/kg (PubMed:29567943).
            Injection into brine shrimp (Artemia salina) stops movement or
            causes death after 24 hours (EC(50)=0.3 uM) (PubMed:34445875). In
            the rare inherited cardiac arrhythmia Brugada syndrome 1 (BRGDA1),
            this toxin is able to restore the loss of function by reducing
            channel inactivation, without affecting activation, by binding to
