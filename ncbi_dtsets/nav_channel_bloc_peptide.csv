            [FUNCTION] Mu-conotoxin KIIIA-P1: mu-conotoxins block voltage-gated
            sodium channels (Nav). This toxin potently blocks Nav1.2/SCN2A
            (IC(50)5-124 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=20-90 nM), and Nav1.7/SCN9A
            (IC(50)=290-413 nM) (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:19221510,
            PubMed:21781281, PubMed:21709136, PubMed:21652775, PubMed:23146020,
            PubMed:25658507, PubMed:35167877). It moderately blocks
            Nav1.1/SCN1A, and mNav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:21781281,
            PubMed:21709136, PubMed:21652775, PubMed:23146020, PubMed:25658507,
            PubMed:35167877). It also shows a very low activity on Nav1.3/SCN3A
            (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:21781281). This toxin binds a microsite
            within the pore different from the tetrodotoxin binding site 1
            (tested on Nav1.2) (PubMed:19221510). The block is partial, with a
            residual current that can be completely blocked by TTX
            (PubMed:19221510). The toxin probably docks at a more superficial
            site in the outer vestibule of the channel than does TTX
            (PubMed:19221510). On rNav1.2/SCN2A, it produces a block that is
            only partially reversible. The block of Nav1.7 is modified when
            beta-subunits are coexpressed with the alpha subunit
            (PubMed:23146020). Hence, blocks of channels containing beta-1 and
            beta-3 subunits are more potent (compared to channels without beta
            subunits), whereas blocks of channels containing beta-2 and beta-4
            subunits are less potent (compared to channels without beta
            subunits) (PubMed:23146020). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15882064,

            [FUNCTION] Toxin that is known to potentiate erectile function
            (PubMed:18397797). It binds voltage-dependently to sodium channels
            (Nav), inhibits the inactivation of the activated channels and
            decreases the peak inward current (PubMed:19231838,
            PubMed:26119670). The toxin delays inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A,
            Nav1.3/SCN3A, Nav1.4/SCN4A and Nav1.8/SCN10A, slows the
            inactivation process and decreases the sodium peak amplitude of
            Nav1.5/SCN5A and Nav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:26119670). In vivo, it
            enhances erectile function by inducing the release of nictric oxide
            (NO): it slows the sodium current, leading to depolarization, which
            leads to an increase in calcium influx (probably via activation of
            N-type calcium channels) which in turn activates neuronal NO
            synthase (nNOS/NOS1), inducing nitric oxide (NO) production
            (PubMed:20722794, PubMed:21975567). In a final step, NO activates
            soluble guanylate cyclase (GUCY1A1/GUCY1B1) which in turn increases
            cGMP formation, resulting in penile erection (PubMed:23583324). It
            is noteworthy that the toxin does not provoke erection by
            inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5A), an enzyme that
            hydrolysis cGMP (PubMed:23583324). In vivo, it also causes
            scratching, lacrimation, hypersalivation, sweating and agitation
            followed by spastic paralysis of the anterior and posterior
            extremities and death at dose levels of 0.79 mg/mouse
            (PubMed:1397265, PubMed:16278100). It is insecticidal to the larval
            and adult forms of the house fly (PubMed:1397265). The toxin also
            improves cavernosal relaxation in different models where erectile
            dysfonction is observed, such as deoxycorticosterone-acetate
            (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats, mice models for type-1 diabetes, as

            [FUNCTION] Mu-conotoxins block voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav).
            This toxin potently blocks rNav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=36-41 nM)
            (PubMed:10627583, PubMed:21652775). It also moderately blocks
            rNav1.1/SCN1A (IC(50)=120 nM), rNav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=620 nM),
            rNav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=3.2 uM), mNav1.6/SCN8A (IC(50)=100 nM)
            (PubMed:10627583, PubMed:21652775). This inhibition is reversible.
            The block of Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6 is modified when
            beta-subunits are coexpressed with alpha subunits. Hence, blocks of
            channels containing the beta-1 and beta-3 subunits are more potent
            (compared to channels without beta subunits), whereas blocks of
            channels containing the beta-2 and beta-4 are less potent (compared
            to channels without beta subunits). In vivo, this peptide causes
            flaccid paralysis in both mice and fish.

            [FUNCTION] Cationic peptide that possesses multiple functions. It
            acts as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), and as a potent
            voltage-gated potassium channel inhibitor. It exhibits
            antimicrobial activities, hind limb paralysis, and severe muscle
            necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. As a cell-penetrating
            peptide, crotamine has high specificity for actively proliferating
            cells, and interacts inside the cell with subcellular and
            subnuclear structures, like vesicular compartments, chromosomes and
            centrioles. It penetrates into the cells as fast as five minutes
            after its addition to cell culture medium (PubMed:18662711). In
            vivo, after intraperitoneal administration, it is found in cells of
            peritoneal fluid and bone marrow, demonstrating preferential
            nuclear and perinuclear localization. To enter the cell, it
            interacts with the chains of heparan sulfate membrane proteoglycan
            (HSPG), and is endocytosed (in complex with HSPG) in vesicles which
            are transported into the cell with the help of clathrin. Inside the
            cell, crotamine accumulates in lysosomal vesicles. As soon as the
            peptide accumulates in endosomes/lysosomes vesicles, these
            compartments are disrupted and their contents released into the
            cytosol. This loss of lysosomal content induces cell death at high
            concentrations, or promotes the distribution of crotamine in
            cytoplasmic compartments, which is a step before crotamine nuclear
            uptake (PubMed:15231729, PubMed:17491023). As a potassium channel
            inhibitor, this toxin selectively inhibits Kv1.1/KCNA1, Kv1.2/KCNA2
            and Kv1.3/KCNA3 channels with an IC(50) of 369, 386 and 287 nM,
            respectively (PubMed:22498659). The inhibition of Kv1.3/KCNA
            channels induced by this toxin occurs rapidly and is
            voltage-independent. The channel inhibition is reversible after
            washing, suggesting a pure and classical channel blockage effect,
            without effects in potassium channel kinetics (PubMed:22498659). As
            an antimicrobial peptide, crotamine shows antibacterial activity
            against E.coli and B.subtilis, and antifungal activity against
            Candida spp., Trichosporon spp. and C.neoformans. It kills bacteria
            through membrane permeabilization. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1176086,

            [CAUTION] The analgesic activity produced by crotamine in Mancin et
            al., 1998 may be a misinterpretation (PubMed:9839677). This
            activity is probably due to the co-elution with the 14 amino acids
            crotalphine peptide (AC P08878). In that article crotamine was
            purified uniquely by gel filtration G-75. This single
            chromatographic step without going through a RP-HPLC is not
            sufficient to separate crotamine from other low molecular weight
            peptides such as the potent analgesic crotalphine peptide.
            {ECO:0000305}.

            of certain specimens of C.durissus terrificus, and absent in

            blocks TTX-sensitive sodium channels in mouse and rat DRG neurons
            (IC(50)=9-27 nM) (PubMed:29723257). It also specifically blocks
            capsaicin-induced rat DRG neuron action potential firing
            (PubMed:29723257). In addition, it specifically blocks
            mechanically-induced C-fiber action potential firing from afferent
            nerve terminals (PubMed:29723257). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29723257}.
            [MISCELLANEOUS] The analog AM-8394 has a propargylglycine (Pra)
            N-terminally inserted, a norleucine (Nle) that replaces Met-59
            (Met-6), and Glu residues instead of Leu-72 (Leu-19) and Ile-81
            (Ile-28) (PubMed:29723257). This analog show a weak inhibitory
            activity on Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)>1 uM) (PubMed:29723257). It does
            not show activity on TTX-sensitive sodium channels in mouse and rat
            DRG neurons (PubMed:29723257). As a consequence, it can be used as
            a negative control peptide. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29723257}.

            [FUNCTION] Calmodulin acts as part of a calcium signal transduction
            pathway by mediating the control of a large number of enzymes, ion
            channels, aquaporins and other proteins through calcium-binding
            (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:23893133, PubMed:26969752,

            PubMed:35568036). Calcium-binding is required for the activation of
            calmodulin (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:23893133, PubMed:26969752,

            PubMed:35568036). Among the enzymes to be stimulated by the
            calmodulin-calcium complex are a number of protein kinases, such as
            myosin light-chain kinases and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
            type II (CaMK2), and phosphatases (PubMed:16760425,

            centrin, is involved in a genetic pathway that regulates the
            centrosome cycle and progression through cytokinesis
            (PubMed:16760425). Is a regulator of voltage-dependent L-type
            calcium channels (PubMed:31454269). Mediates calcium-dependent
            inactivation of CACNA1C (PubMed:26969752). Positively regulates
            calcium-activated potassium channel activity of KCNN2
            (PubMed:27165696). Forms a potassium channel complex with KCNQ1 and
            regulates electrophysiological activity of the channel via
            calcium-binding (PubMed:25441029). Acts as a sensor to modulate the

            [FUNCTION] MuO-conotoxins are gating-modifier toxins that inhibit
            sodium current by trapping the domain II voltage sensor in the
            closed position to prevent opening of the sodium channel. This
            toxin inhibits rNav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=532 nM), rNav1.4/SCN4A

            (PubMed:10627583). It blocks Nav channels by interacting mainly
            with the C-terminal part of the pore loop of domain-3
            (PubMed:16458302). It does not bind on site 1 (PubMed:8890263). At
            small concentration, this toxin also acts as a calcium current
            agonist, whereas at higher doses it blocks fast-inactivating

            Does not inhibit inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A when the channel is
            coexpressed with the beta-1 auxiliary subunit (PubMed:30076230).
            When tested on Nav1.1/SCN1A channel, it enhances peak current
            amplitude and potently delays channel inactivation in a
            dose-dependent manner, leading to a large sustained current
            (PubMed:30076230). It has no effect on the voltage-dependence of
            steady-state activation, and induces a depolarizing shift in the
            voltage dependence of inactivation (PubMed:30076230). In addition,
            it does not modify the recovery from fast inactivation in
            Nav1.1/SCN1A (PubMed:30076230). The binding affinity and subtype
            selectivity of the toxin towards Nav1.1/SCN1A channel is determined
            by residues within both the S1-S2 and S3-S4 loops of the domain IV
            voltage sensor of the channel (PubMed:27281198). This toxin also
            weakly inhibits several subtypes of voltage-gated potassium
            channels (PubMed:27281198). It moderately blocks Kv2.1/KCNB1 (23%
            inhibition at 100 nM), Kv2.2/KCNB2 (19.7% at 100 nM and 51% at 300

            Kv4.3/KCND3 (43% at 300 nM) (PubMed:12065754). In vivo,
            intracerebroventricular injection into mice elicits convulsions,
            spasms, tremors and rapid death (PubMed:12065754). When injected
            into mouse hindpaw, the toxin elicits an immediate and robust
            response to pain (PubMed:27281198). However, intraplantar injection
            of toxin does not cause neurogenic inflammation or alter
            sensitivity to heat, indicative of a modality-specific effect on
            mechanosensitive neurons (PubMed:27281198). In Dravet syndrome mice

            This toxin (GVIIJ(SSG)) blocks Nav1.1/SCN1A (Kd=11 nM),

            newly described site 8, which is composed by two surfaces whose one
            contains a non-disulfide-bonded cysteine (which is free to
            covalently bind the toxin Cys-71) (PubMed:24497506). It is
            noteworthy that coexpression of subunits beta-2 or beta-4 (but not
            beta-1 or beta-3) protects rNav1.1-1.7 against block by the toxin,
            since these subunits (thanks to their extracellular domain)
            covalently bind to the key cysteine of the channel, thus preventing
            the covalent binding of the toxin (PubMed:24497506,

            all sodium channels tested (Ref.1, PubMed:31234412,
            PubMed:31443554). According to Escoubas et al., 2006 and Nicolas et
            al., 2019, it is selective over Nav1.7/SCN9A (90% inhibition at 1
            uM), versus Nav1.4 and Nav1.6 (35% inhibition), and shows a small
            inhibition on all other sodium channels (except Nav1.8/SCN10A)
            (Ref.1, PubMed:31234412). According to Goncalves et al., 2019, it
            shows a similar inhibition on almost all sodium channels tested
            (Nav1.1/SCN1A (IC(50)=280.3 nM), Nav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=73.7 nM),
            Nav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=201.5 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)>2100 nM),

            Nav1.7/SCN9A channel activation and inactivation are not affected,
            suggesting that is does not act as a gating-modifier toxin but
            rather blocks or impedes ion flux through the channel pore (Ref.1,
            PubMed:31234412). The toxin effect is partial and poorly reversible
            (PubMed:31234412). In addition to its inhibition to sodium
            channels, it also shows a small inhibition on rat Kv3.4/KCNC4
            potassium channels (20% inhibition at 1 uM) (PubMed:31234412). In
            vivo, when tested on pain models, it shows analgesic activity

            an opioid analgesic drug and/or an enkephalinase inhibitor, it
            provides an enhanced and effective therapeutic approach to the
            treatment and/or prevention of pain (PubMed:28106092, Ref.2). When
            tested on the OD1-induced mouse model of Nav1.7/SCN9A-mediated
            pain, it almost completely reverses the induced pain
            (PubMed:31443554). In addition, it reduces the response of mice in

            [FUNCTION] Alpha toxins bind voltage-independently at site-3 of
            sodium channels (Nav) and inhibit the inactivation of the activated
            channels thereby blocking neuronal transmission. This toxin is
            active against both mammals and insects, and is classified as an
            alpha-like toxin. It is active on Nav1.2/SCN2A (EC(50)=139-252 nM),
            Nav1.3/SCN3A (EC(50)=565 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A and Nav1.5/SCN5A
            (EC(50)=195-500 nM), Nav1.6/SCN8A (EC(50)=214 nM), and drosophila
            DmNav1 (EC(50)=30 nM) (PubMed:11322948, PubMed:12705833,
            PubMed:15677695, PubMed:19162162, PubMed:20678086). In
            mNav1.6/SCN8A, the toxin induces a large increase in both transient
            and persistent currents, which correlates with a prominent
            reduction in the fast component of inactivating current
            (PubMed:20678086). In rNav1.2/SCN2A and rNav1.3/SCN3A,
            toxin-increased currents is much smaller (PubMed:19162162,
            PubMed:20678086). Moreover, the toxin only accelerates the slow
            inactivation development and delay recovery of mNav1.6/SCN8A
            through binding to the channel in the open state (PubMed:20678086).
            Is 6-fold more toxic than BmK-M2. In vivo, intrahippocampal
            injection into rat induces epileptiform responses
            (PubMed:16229835). In addition, intraplantar injection into rat
            induces spontaneous nociception and hyperalgesia (PubMed:14554105).
