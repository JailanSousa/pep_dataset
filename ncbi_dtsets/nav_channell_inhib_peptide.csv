            [FUNCTION] This lethal neurotoxin (without cyclization at position
            53) inhibits neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2/SCN2A
            (IC(50)=10-150 nM), rNav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=338 nM), Nav1.6/SCN8A
            (IC(50)=117 nM), and hNav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=9.6-33 nM)
            (PubMed:18628201, PubMed:20855463, PubMed:25658507,
            PubMed:29703751, PubMed:31234412, PubMed:23760503). It inhibits
            activation of sodium channel by trapping the voltage sensor of
            domain II (DIIS4) in the closed configuration (PubMed:18628201,
            PubMed:23760503). The toxin neither shifts the Nav1.7/SCN9A
            activation curve nor modifies the slope factor (PubMed:20855463).
            It does not slow fast-inactivation of hNav1.7/SCN9A channels
            (PubMed:20855463). In addition, it has only a weak affinity for
            lipid membranes (PubMed:18054060, PubMed:29703751,
            PubMed:28115115). This toxin also exists with a pyroglutamate at
            position 53 (PubMed:23826086). The sole difference observed between
            modified (mHwTx-IV) and unmodified toxins is that moderate or high
            depolarization voltages (200 mV) permit the unmodified toxin to
            dissociate, whereas mHwTx-IV toxin does not dissociate, even at
            high depolarization voltages (PubMed:23826086). These data indicate
            that mHwTx-IV strongly binds to voltage sensor of sodium channel
            even at extreme depolarization voltages (PubMed:23826086).

            [PTM] Two forms of huwentoxin-IV exist in the venom of H.schmidti,
            a non-N-terminally modified (HwTx-IV) and a naturally modified
            peptide with pyroglutamic acid residue at position 53 (mHwTx-IV).
            mHwTx-IV shows no observable difference with the unmodified toxin
            when applied to the TTX-S sodium channel of DRG neuron (IC(50)
            50 nM) or when tested on hNav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=30.8 nM)
            (PubMed:23826086, PubMed:28115115). In addition, similarly to the
            unmodified toxin, mHwTx-IV has only a weak affinity for lipid
            membranes (PubMed:28115115). However, in contrast with HwTx-IV,
            which dissociates at moderate and high depolarization voltages
            (50-200 mV), mHwTx-IV inhibition of TTX-sensitive sodium channels
            is not reversed by strong depolarization voltages

            nM) (PubMed:25026046, PubMed:31234412). It inhibits both activation
            and inactivation (PubMed:20855463). For inhibition of activation,
            it is 100-fold more selective for Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=0.26-3) than
            for other sodium channels (Nav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=40-540 nM),

            it is 20-fold more potent in inhibiting inactivation on
            Nav1.7/SCN9A (IC(50)=250 nM) than other channels (about 4.6 uM for
            all channels) (PubMed:20855463). It also weakly inhibits

            (PubMed:17087985, PubMed:20600227, PubMed:24886690). It inhibits
            Nav1.7/SCN9A activation by interacting with DII and impairs
            Nav1.7/SCN9A inactivation by interacting with DIV
            (PubMed:20855463). It docks on top of the DII S3 helix Nav1.7/SCN9A
            (PubMed:30661758, PubMed:30765606). It is about 60-fold less active
            on Nav1.7/SCN9A at depolarized potential (0 mV; IC(50)=15 nM),
            compared to -120 mV potential (IC(50)=0.26 nM) (PubMed:30661758).
            This toxin binds to lipid membrane (PubMed:15632158,

            inhibition, showing that membrane binding is the first step in the
            inhibitory mechanism of this toxin (PubMed:27311819). It inhibits
            Nav1.2/SCN2A less potently when it is coexpressed with SCN2B or
            SCN4B than when it is expressed alone, showing that beta subunits

            [FUNCTION] Binds specifically to voltage-gated sodium channels
            (Nav) (site 3), thereby delaying their inactivation. This toxin has
            the highest affinity of all anemone toxins for the mammalian sodium
            channel, whereas its paralog Anthopleurin-A retains the greatest
            capacity to discriminate between cardiac (Nav1.5/SCN5A) and
            neuronal sodium channels (PubMed:8916901). When tested
            electrophysiologically, this toxin exhibits a high affinity for
            multiple sodium channels with a 50-fold preference for rat cardiac
            (Nav1.5/SCN5A) over neuronal channels (0.1 nM versus 5 nM). When
            tested by ion flux, the affinities are similar and appear to have
            higher affinity (9 nM versus 22 nM) (PubMed:8276803,
            PubMed:7612595). The residue Lys-37 of this toxin has been shown to
            interact with channel Nav1.5 (residue Asp-1612 in rat and Asp-1610
            in human), which is located in the DIV S3-S4 linker (corresponding
            to channel site 3) (PubMed:9417050, PubMed:24898004). Selectively
            modifies sodium channel inactivation from the open state with
            little effect on channel activation or on inactivation from closed

            (IC(50)5-124 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=20-90 nM), and Nav1.7/SCN9A

            Nav1.1/SCN1A, and mNav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:21781281,

            (PubMed:17724025, PubMed:21781281). This toxin binds a microsite
            within the pore different from the tetrodotoxin binding site 1
            (tested on Nav1.2) (PubMed:19221510). The block is partial, with a
            residual current that can be completely blocked by TTX
            (PubMed:19221510). The toxin probably docks at a more superficial
            site in the outer vestibule of the channel than does TTX
            (PubMed:19221510). On rNav1.2/SCN2A, it produces a block that is
            only partially reversible. The block of Nav1.7 is modified when
            beta-subunits are coexpressed with the alpha subunit
            (PubMed:23146020). Hence, blocks of channels containing beta-1 and
            beta-3 subunits are more potent (compared to channels without beta
            subunits), whereas blocks of channels containing beta-2 and beta-4
            subunits are less potent (compared to channels without beta

            [FUNCTION] Cationic peptide that possesses multiple functions. It
            acts as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), and as a potent
            voltage-gated potassium channel inhibitor. It exhibits
            antimicrobial activities, hind limb paralysis, and severe muscle
            necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. As a cell-penetrating
            peptide, crotamine has high specificity for actively proliferating
            cells, and interacts inside the cell with subcellular and
            subnuclear structures, like vesicular compartments, chromosomes and
            centrioles. It penetrates into the cells as fast as five minutes
            after its addition to cell culture medium (PubMed:18662711). In
            vivo, after intraperitoneal administration, it is found in cells of
            peritoneal fluid and bone marrow, demonstrating preferential
            nuclear and perinuclear localization. To enter the cell, it
            interacts with the chains of heparan sulfate membrane proteoglycan
            (HSPG), and is endocytosed (in complex with HSPG) in vesicles which
            are transported into the cell with the help of clathrin. Inside the
            cell, crotamine accumulates in lysosomal vesicles. As soon as the
            peptide accumulates in endosomes/lysosomes vesicles, these
            compartments are disrupted and their contents released into the
            cytosol. This loss of lysosomal content induces cell death at high
            concentrations, or promotes the distribution of crotamine in
            cytoplasmic compartments, which is a step before crotamine nuclear
            uptake (PubMed:15231729, PubMed:17491023). As a potassium channel
            inhibitor, this toxin selectively inhibits Kv1.1/KCNA1, Kv1.2/KCNA2
            and Kv1.3/KCNA3 channels with an IC(50) of 369, 386 and 287 nM,
            respectively (PubMed:22498659). The inhibition of Kv1.3/KCNA
            channels induced by this toxin occurs rapidly and is
            voltage-independent. The channel inhibition is reversible after
            washing, suggesting a pure and classical channel blockage effect,
            without effects in potassium channel kinetics (PubMed:22498659). As
            an antimicrobial peptide, crotamine shows antibacterial activity
            against E.coli and B.subtilis, and antifungal activity against
            Candida spp., Trichosporon spp. and C.neoformans. It kills bacteria
            through membrane permeabilization. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1176086,

            al., 1998 may be a misinterpretation (PubMed:9839677). This
            activity is probably due to the co-elution with the 14 amino acids
            crotalphine peptide (AC P08878). In that article crotamine was
            purified uniquely by gel filtration G-75. This single
            chromatographic step without going through a RP-HPLC is not
            sufficient to separate crotamine from other low molecular weight
            peptides such as the potent analgesic crotalphine peptide.

            it selectively inhibits Nav1.7/SCN9A or shows similar potency on
            all sodium channels tested (Ref.1, PubMed:31234412,
            PubMed:31443554). According to Escoubas et al., 2006 and Nicolas et
            al., 2019, it is selective over Nav1.7/SCN9A (90% inhibition at 1
            uM), versus Nav1.4 and Nav1.6 (35% inhibition), and shows a small
            inhibition on all other sodium channels (except Nav1.8/SCN10A)
            (Ref.1, PubMed:31234412). According to Goncalves et al., 2019, it
            shows a similar inhibition on almost all sodium channels tested
            (Nav1.1/SCN1A (IC(50)=280.3 nM), Nav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=73.7 nM),
            Nav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=201.5 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)>2100 nM),

            (PubMed:31443554). The voltage-dependence of steady-state
            Nav1.7/SCN9A channel activation and inactivation are not affected,
            suggesting that is does not act as a gating-modifier toxin but
            rather blocks or impedes ion flux through the channel pore (Ref.1,
            PubMed:31234412). The toxin effect is partial and poorly reversible
            (PubMed:31234412). In addition to its inhibition to sodium
            channels, it also shows a small inhibition on rat Kv3.4/KCNC4
            potassium channels (20% inhibition at 1 uM) (PubMed:31234412). In
            vivo, when tested on pain models, it shows analgesic activity

            Nav1.5/SCN5A (PubMed:17176080, PubMed:25240294). It significantly
            shifts the activation to more depolarized voltages and decreases
            the deactivation of Nav1.5 currents upon extreme depolarization,

            recovery from inactivation and an approximately 1.9-fold reduction
            in the closed-state inactivation rate (PubMed:25240294). This toxin

            the deactivation of Nav1.5 currents upon extreme depolarization,
            but only slightly affects voltage-dependence of steady-state
            inactivation (PubMed:17176080, PubMed:25240294). In addition, this
            toxin causes an approximately five-fold decrease in the rate of
            recovery from inactivation and an approximately 1.9-fold reduction
            in the closed-state inactivation rate (PubMed:25240294). This toxin

            (PubMed:25240294). It inhibits the sodium conductance (IC(50)=124
            nM) and slows the fast inactivation (EC(50)=1180 nM) of
            Nav1.5/SCN5A (PubMed:17176080, PubMed:25240294). It significantly
            shifts the activation to more depolarized voltages and decreases
            the deactivation of Nav1.5 currents upon extreme depolarization,
            but only slightly affects voltage-dependence of steady-state
            inactivation (PubMed:17176080, PubMed:25240294). In addition, this
            toxin causes an approximately five-fold decrease in the rate of
            recovery from inactivation and an approximately 1.9-fold reduction
            in the closed-state inactivation rate (PubMed:25240294). This toxin
            integrates the functions of site 3 toxins (alpha-scorpion toxins)
            with site 4 toxins (beta-scorpion and spider toxins) by targeting
            multiple sites on Nav1.5 (PubMed:25240294). Also shows inhibition
            of voltage-gated potassium channels (5 uM completely inhibits

            (EC(50)=38 nM) (PubMed:27281198, PubMed:30076230). Also moderately
            inhibits inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A (EC(50)=236 nM) and
            Nav1.3/SCN3A (EC(50)=220 nM) when the channels are expressed in

            Does not inhibit inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A when the channel is
            coexpressed with the beta-1 auxiliary subunit (PubMed:30076230).
            When tested on Nav1.1/SCN1A channel, it enhances peak current
            amplitude and potently delays channel inactivation in a
            dose-dependent manner, leading to a large sustained current
            (PubMed:30076230). It has no effect on the voltage-dependence of
            steady-state activation, and induces a depolarizing shift in the
            voltage dependence of inactivation (PubMed:30076230). In addition,
            it does not modify the recovery from fast inactivation in
            Nav1.1/SCN1A (PubMed:30076230). The binding affinity and subtype
            selectivity of the toxin towards Nav1.1/SCN1A channel is determined
            by residues within both the S1-S2 and S3-S4 loops of the domain IV
            voltage sensor of the channel (PubMed:27281198). This toxin also
            weakly inhibits several subtypes of voltage-gated potassium
            channels (PubMed:27281198). It moderately blocks Kv2.1/KCNB1 (23%
            inhibition at 100 nM), Kv2.2/KCNB2 (19.7% at 100 nM and 51% at 300
            nM), Kv4.1/KCND1 (IC(50)=280 nM), Kv4.2/KCND2 (39% at 300 nM) and
            Kv4.3/KCND3 (43% at 300 nM) (PubMed:12065754). In vivo,
            intracerebroventricular injection into mice elicits convulsions,
            spasms, tremors and rapid death (PubMed:12065754). When injected
            into mouse hindpaw, the toxin elicits an immediate and robust
            response to pain (PubMed:27281198). However, intraplantar injection
            of toxin does not cause neurogenic inflammation or alter
            sensitivity to heat, indicative of a modality-specific effect on
            mechanosensitive neurons (PubMed:27281198). In Dravet syndrome mice

            GS-omega/kappa-Hxtx-Hv1a. They are effective against thrips,
            whiteflies, and spider mites in greenhouse settings. They have a
            large molecular weight, are hydrophilic, and have many hydrogen
            donors. They kill some insects on contact. The peptides block two
            ion channels in the insect nervous system (a voltage-gated calcium
            channel (Cav) and a calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa)).

            deliver the toxin to sites of action within the insect central
            nervous system (PubMed:22761779). The Hv1a/GNA variant does not

            inactivation of rat Nav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=870 nM), rat Nav1.3/SCN3A
            (IC(50)=845 nM), rat Nav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=339 nM), human

            and steady-state inactivation kinetics in the physiological range
            of voltages (PubMed:26721415). Site-directed mutagenesis of the
            sodium channel indicates that the toxin interacts with site 3
            located at the extracellular S3-S4 linker of domain IV
            (PubMed:26721415). On potassium channels, it inhibits activation of
            channels with an IC(50) of 8.05 uM through a voltage
            sensor-trapping mechanism (PubMed:23246579). It increases muscle
            contraction in several assays (mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm, toad
            heart, rat vas deferens) and is suggested to act both

            [FUNCTION] Acts as a gating modifier on both Kv and Nav ion
            channels, and also acts on blood pressure. Voltage-dependently
            inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels Kv3 (Kv3.1/KCNC1,
            Kv3.2/KCNC2 and Kv3.4/KCNC4) and slows inactivation of the

            tests have been done on human Nav1.7/SCN9A (expressed in HEK293

            [FUNCTION] Mu-conotoxins block voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav).
            This toxin potently blocks rNav1.4/SCN4A (IC(50)=36-41 nM)
            (PubMed:10627583, PubMed:21652775). It also moderately blocks
            rNav1.1/SCN1A (IC(50)=120 nM), rNav1.2/SCN2A (IC(50)=620 nM),
            rNav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=3.2 uM), mNav1.6/SCN8A (IC(50)=100 nM)
            (PubMed:10627583, PubMed:21652775). This inhibition is reversible.
            The block of Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6 is modified when
            beta-subunits are coexpressed with alpha subunits. Hence, blocks of
            channels containing the beta-1 and beta-3 subunits are more potent
            (compared to channels without beta subunits), whereas blocks of
            channels containing the beta-2 and beta-4 are less potent (compared
            to channels without beta subunits). In vivo, this peptide causes
            flaccid paralysis in both mice and fish.

            PIIIA-2 contains the cysteine connectivity described as typical for

            [FUNCTION] Calmodulin acts as part of a calcium signal transduction
            pathway by mediating the control of a large number of enzymes, ion
            channels, aquaporins and other proteins through calcium-binding
            (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:23893133, PubMed:26969752,
            PubMed:27165696, PubMed:28890335, PubMed:31454269,
            PubMed:35568036). Calcium-binding is required for the activation of
            calmodulin (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:23893133, PubMed:26969752,
            PubMed:27165696, PubMed:28890335, PubMed:31454269,
            PubMed:35568036). Among the enzymes to be stimulated by the
            calmodulin-calcium complex are a number of protein kinases, such as
            myosin light-chain kinases and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
            type II (CaMK2), and phosphatases (PubMed:16760425,

            PubMed:31454269, PubMed:35568036). Together with CCP110 and
            centrin, is involved in a genetic pathway that regulates the
            centrosome cycle and progression through cytokinesis
            (PubMed:16760425). Is a regulator of voltage-dependent L-type
            calcium channels (PubMed:31454269). Mediates calcium-dependent
            inactivation of CACNA1C (PubMed:26969752). Positively regulates
            calcium-activated potassium channel activity of KCNN2
            (PubMed:27165696). Forms a potassium channel complex with KCNQ1 and
            regulates electrophysiological activity of the channel via
            calcium-binding (PubMed:25441029). Acts as a sensor to modulate the

            PubMed:29703751). The toxin acts by shifting the voltage dependence
            of channel activation to more depolarized potentials and by
            blocking the inward component of the sodium current
            (PubMed:16267209). It shows moderate affinity for lipid bilayers
            without cholesterol and high affinity for lipid bilayers containing
            cholesterol (PubMed:29703751). In vivo, this toxin causes general
            ataxia, lack of response to stimuli, and semiparalysis
            (PubMed:16267209). After a few minutes, the mice are unable to
            stand, and breathing is reduced in rhythm and intensity
            (PubMed:16267209). Symptoms gradually increase with progressive
            slowing of breathing and flaccid paralysis; death occurred within
            10 to 20 minutes post injection (PubMed:16267209). Animals remain
            totally flaccid, and no symptoms of excitatory neurotoxicity are

            [FUNCTION] MuO-conotoxins are gating-modifier toxins that inhibit

            [FUNCTION] Delta-conotoxins bind to site 6 of voltage-gated sodium
            channels (Nav) and inhibit the inactivation process. Binding of
            this toxin is strongly calcium-dependent but not voltage-dependent.
            The binding site is most likely on the extracellular side of the
            sodium channel. Binds receptor sites on both mollusk and rat
            central nervous system, but despite its high affinity binding to
            rat sodium channel, it has no functional effect in vivo and in
            vitro on it. Has also no effect on Gambusia fish. Is important in
            mollusk for the paralysis of the prey. Upon injection of the
            peptide, a subordinate lobster assumes an exaggerated dominant

            [FUNCTION] Toxin that is known to potentiate erectile function
            (PubMed:18397797). It binds voltage-dependently to sodium channels
            (Nav), inhibits the inactivation of the activated channels and
            decreases the peak inward current (PubMed:19231838,
            PubMed:26119670). The toxin delays inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A,
            Nav1.3/SCN3A, Nav1.4/SCN4A and Nav1.8/SCN10A, slows the
            inactivation process and decreases the sodium peak amplitude of
            Nav1.5/SCN5A and Nav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:26119670). In vivo, it
            enhances erectile function by inducing the release of nictric oxide
            (NO): it slows the sodium current, leading to depolarization, which
            leads to an increase in calcium influx (probably via activation of
            N-type calcium channels) which in turn activates neuronal NO
            synthase (nNOS/NOS1), inducing nitric oxide (NO) production
            (PubMed:20722794, PubMed:21975567). In a final step, NO activates
            soluble guanylate cyclase (GUCY1A1/GUCY1B1) which in turn increases
            cGMP formation, resulting in penile erection (PubMed:23583324). It
            is noteworthy that the toxin does not provoke erection by
            inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5A), an enzyme that
            hydrolysis cGMP (PubMed:23583324). In vivo, it also causes
            scratching, lacrimation, hypersalivation, sweating and agitation
            followed by spastic paralysis of the anterior and posterior
            extremities and death at dose levels of 0.79 mg/mouse
            (PubMed:1397265, PubMed:16278100). It is insecticidal to the larval
            and adult forms of the house fly (PubMed:1397265). The toxin also
            improves cavernosal relaxation in different models where erectile
            dysfonction is observed, such as deoxycorticosterone-acetate
            (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats, mice models for type-1 diabetes, as
            well as elderly rats (PubMed:18397797, PubMed:21975567,

            (PubMed:23356888, PubMed:24749540). The activity on sodium channels
            consists of inhibition on sodium current inactivation with no
            significant effect on current activation. This effect may be caused
            by direct interaction of the toxin with sodium channel site-3
            (PubMed:23356888, PubMed:24749540). The activity on potassium
            channels consists of a significant increase of the amplitude of the
            transient component of the potassium current, shifting the current
            threshold to more negative membrane potentials. These effects are
            concentration-dependent and reversible and may be due to a direct
            interaction between the toxin and the voltage-sensing domain of the
            channel (PubMed:24749540). Physiologically, this toxin increases
            the amplitude of cardiomyocyte contraction and slows the late phase
            of the twitch relaxation velocity with no induction of spontaneous
            twitching. It increases action potential duration of cardiomyocytes

            [FUNCTION] Alpha toxins bind voltage-independently at site-3 of
            sodium channels (Nav) and inhibit the inactivation of the activated
            channels, thereby blocking neuronal transmission (PubMed:2536799,
            PubMed:15249424, PubMed:15051403). This synthetic toxin inhibits
            inactivation of rat Nav1.4/SCN4A (when tested at 201 nM)
            (PubMed:27244051). In addition, it has been shown to cause a

            innervating the rabbit corpus cavernosum, resulting in NO release
            and cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation (PubMed:12551849). This

            [FUNCTION] Alpha toxins bind voltage-independently at site-3 of
            sodium channels (Nav) and inhibit the inactivation of the activated
            channels thereby blocking neuronal transmission. This toxin is
            active against both mammals and insects, and is classified as an
            alpha-like toxin. It is active on Nav1.2/SCN2A (EC(50)=139-252 nM),
            Nav1.3/SCN3A (EC(50)=565 nM), Nav1.4/SCN4A and Nav1.5/SCN5A

            mNav1.6/SCN8A, the toxin induces a large increase in both transient
            and persistent currents, which correlates with a prominent
            reduction in the fast component of inactivating current
            (PubMed:20678086). In rNav1.2/SCN2A and rNav1.3/SCN3A,
            toxin-increased currents is much smaller (PubMed:19162162,
            PubMed:20678086). Moreover, the toxin only accelerates the slow
            inactivation development and delay recovery of mNav1.6/SCN8A
            through binding to the channel in the open state (PubMed:20678086).
            Is 6-fold more toxic than BmK-M2. In vivo, intrahippocampal
            injection into rat induces epileptiform responses
            (PubMed:16229835). In addition, intraplantar injection into rat

            (Nav) (site 3), thereby delaying their inactivation. This toxin
            retains the greatest capacity to discriminate between the cardiac
            (Nav1.5/SCN5A) and neuronal sodium channels (2.5 nM versus 120 nM,
            when electrophysiologically tested and 14 nM versus 400 nM, when

            channel (PubMed:13806, PubMed:7612595, PubMed:17092528). Its
            ability to differentiate between cardiac and skeletal channels

            (PubMed:9306007). This toxin does not slow or inhibit closed-state

            inactivation from the open-state (PubMed:8576699). It does not

            inhibits the inactivation process (PubMed:18538344). Is highly
            active on DmNav1/TipE (drosophila) and is only extremely weakly
            active on rat Nav1.4-beta-1/SCN4A-SCN1B, and on human
            Nav1.5-beta-1/SCN5A-beta-1 (PubMed:18538344). This reveals high
            specificity for arthropod over mammalian channels
            (PubMed:18538344). In vivo, when released into the medium, this
            recombinant toxin induces impaired swimming, paralysis and death of
            the crustacean A.nauplii within several hours (PubMed:22048953).
            Also causes paralysis of cherry shrimps immediately after injection
            at very low doses (PubMed:29424690). Its effect on zebrafish
            (D.rerio) larvae is also rapid, since it induces tail twitching
            accompanied by impaired swimming after 20 minutes and complete
            paralysis within 45 minutes (PubMed:22048953). It has also been

            [FUNCTION] Reversible inhibitor of voltage-gated sodium channels
            (Nav). Delays the fast inactivation kinetics of neuronal-type
            sodium channels. In vivo, it induces rat penile erection
            (PubMed:15246765). This effect may be due to the neuronal nitric
            oxide synthase (NOS1), since one of its selective inhibitor
            completely abolishes all the toxic effects of the toxin
            (PubMed:15246765). This toxin also causes scratching, lacrimation,
            hypersalivation, sweating and agitation followed by spastic
            paralysis of the anterior and posterior extremities and death at
            dose levels of 0.24 mg/mouse (PubMed:1397265, PubMed:16278100,

            the crustacean A.nauplii within several hours (PubMed:22048953).
            Also causes paralysis of cherry shrimps immediately after injection
            at very low doses (PubMed:29424690). Its effect on zebrafish
            (D.rerio) larvae is also rapid, since it induces tail twitching
            accompanied by impaired swimming after 20 minutes and complete
            paralysis within 45 minutes (PubMed:22048953). It has also been
            observed to cause death of zebrafish larvae within 1 hour
            (PubMed:31134275). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18538344,

            level) (PubMed:29424690, PubMed:31134275). Is also detected in late
            planulae, primary polyps and adults (both females and males) (at
            protein level) (PubMed:22048953, PubMed:29424690). Nv1 is
            transcribed throughout the complete life cycle and is found at
            multiple developmental stages including unfertilized eggs,
            blastulae, gastrulae, early planulae, planulae, metamorphosing
            planulae, primary polyps, juvenile polyps (2 and 4 months old),
            adult males, and adult females, with highest levels in juvenile
            polyps and adults (PubMed:18538344, PubMed:29424690). Importantly,
            Nv1 transcripts are not spliced in the embryo and planula due to
            intron retention and therefore Nv1 can be considered purely an
            adult toxin (PubMed:18538344). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18538344,

            [MISCELLANEOUS] Nv1 toxin seems to be encoded by 8 different genes.
            4 of them code for identical precursors, whereas 4 others code for
            very similar precursors. In the genome draft, 6 additional loci are
            also correlated to Nv1 toxin, but they are not predicted to be
            functional genes. This high similarity may be explained by
            concerted evolution.
            [MISCELLANEOUS] The primary structure of the mature peptide is
            identical in 9 entries (AC B1NWS4, AC B1NWS1, AC B1NWR6, AC P0CH90,
