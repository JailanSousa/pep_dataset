            [FUNCTION] This cationic hydrophobic peptide acts on a lot of
            different channels and has an antimicrobial activity. It blocks
            mechanosensitive ion channels (also named stretch-activated
            channels or SACs), without having effect on whole-cell
            voltage-sensitive currents. It also affects acetylcholine receptors
            (nAChRs) through interactions with membrane lipids by prolonging
            the closing time without affecting channel conductance or opening
            activity (PubMed:34374321). It shows high affinity for lipid
            bilayers (PubMed:15241420, PubMed:29703751). It acts by
            partitioning into the membrane and perturbing the interface between
            the channel and the lipid bilayer without necessarily being in
            physical contact with the channel. It inhibits atrial fibrillation
            as well as the membrane motor of outer hair cells at low doses. It
            also binds to the voltage sensor of voltage-gated potassium
            channels from the archaebacterium Aeropyrum pernix (KvAP) without
            affecting channel gating. It shows also a low inhibition on a large
            spectra of sodium channels (Nav1.1/SCN1A, Nav1.2/SCN2A,
            Nav1.3/SCN3A, Nav1.4/SCN4A, Nav1.5/SCN5A, Nav1.6/SCN8A,
            Nav1.7/SCN9A) (IC(50)=7.4-14 uM), and potassium channels
            Kv11.1/KCNH2 and Kv11.2/KCNH6 (IC(50)=11 uM for both)
            (PubMed:19955179, PubMed:29703751). It exhibits antimicrobial
            activities against the Gram-positive bacteria B.subtilis (MIC=0.5
            uM), S.aureus (MIC=2-4 uM), and S.epidermidis (MIC=4-8 uM), and

            ASIC3 homotrimers and heterotrimers containing ASIC3 (composed with
            isoforms of ASIC1 and ASIC2) (PubMed:15044953). It also weakly
            inhibits potassium channels, and sodium channels (PubMed:15044953,
            PubMed:21943094, PubMed:22972919, PubMed:25337890). On homomeric
            ASIC3, this protein shows IC(50)=57-87 nM on rat, 37.3 nM on mouse
            and 175 nM on human channels (PubMed:15044953, PubMed:18923424,
            PubMed:19306891, PubMed:20813121, PubMed:21943094, PubMed:22851922,
            PubMed:22851929). The blockade is rapid and reversible
            (PubMed:15044953). On heterotrimeric forms, the toxin is less
            potent (IC(50)=117 nM on rat ASIC2b-ASIC3 channel, 900 nM on rat
            ASIC1b-ASIC3, and 2 uM on rat ASIC1a-ASIC3) (PubMed:15044953). It
            weakly inhibits Kv3.4/KCNC4 potassium channels (3 uM of the toxin
            inhibits 38% of Kv3.4 current) (PubMed:15044953). It reversibly and
            voltage-dependently inhibits hKv11.1/KCNH2/ERG1 potassium channels
            (IC(50)=1.21 uM), inhibiting both peak and tail currents without
            action on channel inactivation (PubMed:25337890). It weakly
            inhibits rNav1.2/SCN2A (EC(50)=114 nM), rNav1.6/SCN8A current (17%
            at 1 uM of the toxin) and Nav1.8/SCN10A (IC(50)=6.6 uM on human
            channels expressed in oocytes, EC(50)=55 nM on rat channels
            expressed in oocytes, and 2.6 uM on rat channels in DRG neurons)
            (PubMed:21943094, PubMed:22972919). It may act on sodium channels
            by binding at site 1 or close by, when the pore is in an open
            configuration (PubMed:22972919). In vivo, central injection does
            not induce neurotoxin symptoms in mice even after 24 hours
            (PubMed:15044953). However, it abolishes acid-induced pain in rats

            [PHARMACEUTICAL] Synthetic analog ShK-186 is under clinical trial
            by 'Kv1.3 Therapeutics, Inc.' under the name dalazatide. Dalazatide
            has been validated in multiple models of autoimmune disease and has
            demonstrated proof of concept in a Phase 1b study in psoriasis.
            Dalazatide is ready to begin Phase 2 clinical studies for inclusion
            body myositis (IBM) a rare disease with no approved treatment
            options and generally poor prognosis for the patients. The
            dalazatide development program is focused on providing a
            breakthrough treatment first for IBM and then followed by other
            rare and autoimmune diseases. ShK-186 contains an L-phosphotyrosine
            attached via an aeea (mini-PEG) hydrophilic linker to Arg-1 and is
            amidated. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19122005,

            [MISCELLANEOUS] The synthetic analog ShK-192 has a
            paraphosphono-Phe (Ppa) at position 0, a Norleucine at position 21,
            and is amidated. It is stable at acidic pH values and high
            temperatures. The circulating half-life of the synthetic mutant is
            estimated to be about 30 minutes in rats. However, low
            concentrations of functionally active peptide are detected in the
            blood 72 hours after the injection. The synthetic mutant
            effectively inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes (T(EM))
            cells in rats and suppresses delayed type hypersensitivity when
            administered at 10 or 100 ug/kg by subcutaneous injection once
            daily. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19122005}.
            [MISCELLANEOUS] The synthetic analog ShK-145 has a 20 kDa
            polyethylene glycol (PEG), and a Lys at position 16. In vivo, its
            injection into rat model of multiple sclerosis inhibits the
            progression of the disease. In addition, weekly administration of
            ShK-145 suppress interleukin-17 (IL-17) cytokine secretion from T

            an inhibitor on ASIC1a (ASIC isoform 2) and a potentiator on ASIC1b
            (ASIC isoform 3) (PubMed:10829030, PubMed:15955877,
            PubMed:21036899). This toxin potently and selectively inhibits rat,
            mouse and human ASIC1a (IC(50)=0.35-3.7 nM) (PubMed:10829030,
            PubMed:15955877, PubMed:21715637, PubMed:26248594,
            PubMed:21825095). The blockade is rapidly reversible
            (PubMed:10829030, PubMed:28320941). The toxin acts by shifting its
            steady-state desensitization to more alkaline pH (0.27 pH unit)
            (PubMed:15955877, PubMed:16505147). At higher concentrations, it
            potentiates rat and human ASIC1b and activates chicken ASIC1 by
            stabilizing the open state of these subtypes (PubMed:16505147,
            PubMed:21036899, PubMed:19185346, PubMed:24262969,
            PubMed:22842900). The toxin binds most tightly to the open and the
            desensitized states of ASIC1a (promoting desensitization), whereas
            it binds most tightly to the open state of ASIC1b (promoting
            opening) (PubMed:16505147). The toxin also inhibits mouse
            ASIC1a-ASIC2b (IC(50)=2.64 nM) and rat ASIC1a-ASIC2a
            (PubMed:21715637, PubMed:27277303). It binds to the extracellular
            domain at subunit interfaces in the acidic pocket with the majority
            of contacts on the thumb domain of the channel (PubMed:21825095,
            PubMed:22842900, PubMed:22760635). It is also noteworthy that
            calcium competes with the toxin, probably by inhibiting binding of
            the toxin to the channel (PubMed:15955877).

            [FUNCTION] Regulatory subunit of the calcium activated potassium
            KCNMA1 (maxiK) channel. Modulates the calcium sensitivity and
            gating kinetics of KCNMA1, thereby contributing to KCNMA1 channel
            diversity. Increases the apparent Ca(2+)/voltage sensitivity of the
            KCNMA1 channel. It also modifies KCNMA1 channel kinetics and alters
            its pharmacological properties. It slows down the activation and
            the deactivation kinetics of the channel. Acts as a negative
            regulator of smooth muscle contraction by enhancing the calcium
            sensitivity to KCNMA1. Its presence is also a requirement for
            internal binding of the KCNMA1 channel opener dehydrosoyasaponin I
            (DHS-1) triterpene glycoside and for external binding of the
            agonist hormone 17-beta-estradiol (E2). Increases the binding
            activity of charybdotoxin (CTX) toxin to KCNMA1 peptide blocker by

            [FUNCTION] During virus replication, may deplete host UNG protein,
            and incude G2-M cell cycle arrest. Acts by targeting specific host
            proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome, through association
            with the cellular CUL4A-DDB1 E3 ligase complex by direct
            interaction with host VPRPB/DCAF-1. Cell cycle arrest reportedly
            occurs within hours of infection and is not blocked by antiviral
            agents, suggesting that it is initiated by the VPR carried into the
            virion. Additionally, VPR induces apoptosis in a cell cycle
            dependent manner suggesting that these two effects are
            mechanistically linked. Detected in the serum and cerebrospinal
            fluid of AIDS patient, VPR may also induce cell death to bystander
            cells. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04080}.

            macrophages. May act directly at the nuclear pore complex, by

            endoplasmic and as a consequence releases Ca(2+) in the cytoplasm
            of infected cell. In turn, high levels of cytoplasmic calcium

            reference sequence was derived from AI857458.1, BC104470.1 and
            BU619919.1.
            This sequence is a reference standard in the RefSeqGene project.
            
            Summary: This gene encodes a member of the
            sauvagine/corticotropin-releasing factor/urotensin I family. The
            encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the
            mature peptide, an endogenous ligand for both
            corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 and
            corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2. In the brain this
            peptide may be responsible for the effects of stress on appetite.
            This peptide may also play a role in mood disorders,
            neurodegeneration, and skeletal system disorders. In spite of the
            gene family name similarity, the product of this gene has no
            sequence similarity to urotensin-2. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016].
