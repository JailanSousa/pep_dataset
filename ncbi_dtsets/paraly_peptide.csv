            expressed in HEK-293 cells (EC(50)=14 nM and 65 nM respectively).
            Since TRPV6 channels are overexpressed in a number of cancers
            (including breast, prostate, ovarian), these analogs have potential
            application as diagnostic and therapeutic tools to detect or treat
            TRPV6-rich tumors. It is noteworthy that these peptides delivered a
            conjugated fluorescent label to TRPV6-rich xenografts of human
            ovarian cancer (SK-OV-3) and prostate cancer (DU-145) and
            negatively affected a number of epithelial-type cancer cell lines
            including SK-OV-3 in preliminary in vivo and in vitro studies.
            Additionally, a negative contrast MRI agent to which SOR-C27 was
            chemically attached targeted SK-OV-3 xenografts allowing detection
            and accurate determination of tumor volume (PubMed:23554944).
            Furthermore, daily injection into SK-OV-3 xenografts mice with
            SOR-C13 or SOR-C27 over 12 days inhibits tumor growth by more that
            50% at the highest dose compared to non-treated controls

            [FUNCTION] Cationic peptide that possesses multiple functions. It
            acts as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), and as a potent
            voltage-gated potassium channel inhibitor. It exhibits
            antimicrobial activities, hind limb paralysis, and severe muscle
            necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism. As a cell-penetrating
            peptide, crotamine has high specificity for actively proliferating
            cells, and interacts inside the cell with subcellular and
            subnuclear structures, like vesicular compartments, chromosomes and
            centrioles. It penetrates into the cells as fast as five minutes
            after its addition to cell culture medium (PubMed:18662711). In
            vivo, after intraperitoneal administration, it is found in cells of
            peritoneal fluid and bone marrow, demonstrating preferential
            nuclear and perinuclear localization. To enter the cell, it
            interacts with the chains of heparan sulfate membrane proteoglycan
            (HSPG), and is endocytosed (in complex with HSPG) in vesicles which
            are transported into the cell with the help of clathrin. Inside the
            cell, crotamine accumulates in lysosomal vesicles. As soon as the
            peptide accumulates in endosomes/lysosomes vesicles, these
            compartments are disrupted and their contents released into the
            cytosol. This loss of lysosomal content induces cell death at high
            concentrations, or promotes the distribution of crotamine in
            cytoplasmic compartments, which is a step before crotamine nuclear
            uptake (PubMed:15231729, PubMed:17491023). As a potassium channel
            inhibitor, this toxin selectively inhibits Kv1.1/KCNA1, Kv1.2/KCNA2
            and Kv1.3/KCNA3 channels with an IC(50) of 369, 386 and 287 nM,
            respectively (PubMed:22498659). The inhibition of Kv1.3/KCNA
            channels induced by this toxin occurs rapidly and is
            voltage-independent. The channel inhibition is reversible after
            washing, suggesting a pure and classical channel blockage effect,
            without effects in potassium channel kinetics (PubMed:22498659). As
            an antimicrobial peptide, crotamine shows antibacterial activity
            against E.coli and B.subtilis, and antifungal activity against
            Candida spp., Trichosporon spp. and C.neoformans. It kills bacteria
            through membrane permeabilization. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1176086,

            [CAUTION] The analgesic activity produced by crotamine in Mancin et
            al., 1998 may be a misinterpretation (PubMed:9839677). This
            activity is probably due to the co-elution with the 14 amino acids
            crotalphine peptide (AC P08878). In that article crotamine was
            purified uniquely by gel filtration G-75. This single
            chromatographic step without going through a RP-HPLC is not
            sufficient to separate crotamine from other low molecular weight
            peptides such as the potent analgesic crotalphine peptide.
            {ECO:0000305}.

            of certain specimens of C.durissus terrificus, and absent in
            others. This is due to geographical variations (PubMed:10484745).

            (PubMed:34302796). It is insecticidal, since it induces reversible
            paralysis in insects (L.cuprina) after 1 hour, but fails to kill
            flies (PubMed:34302796). It shows a relatively strong and
            broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive

            [FUNCTION] Toxin that is known to potentiate erectile function
            (PubMed:18397797). It binds voltage-dependently to sodium channels
            (Nav), inhibits the inactivation of the activated channels and
            decreases the peak inward current (PubMed:19231838,
            PubMed:26119670). The toxin delays inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A,
            Nav1.3/SCN3A, Nav1.4/SCN4A and Nav1.8/SCN10A, slows the
            inactivation process and decreases the sodium peak amplitude of
            Nav1.5/SCN5A and Nav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:26119670). In vivo, it
            enhances erectile function by inducing the release of nictric oxide
            (NO): it slows the sodium current, leading to depolarization, which
            leads to an increase in calcium influx (probably via activation of
            N-type calcium channels) which in turn activates neuronal NO
            synthase (nNOS/NOS1), inducing nitric oxide (NO) production
            (PubMed:20722794, PubMed:21975567). In a final step, NO activates
            soluble guanylate cyclase (GUCY1A1/GUCY1B1) which in turn increases
            cGMP formation, resulting in penile erection (PubMed:23583324). It
            is noteworthy that the toxin does not provoke erection by
            inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5A), an enzyme that
            hydrolysis cGMP (PubMed:23583324). In vivo, it also causes
            scratching, lacrimation, hypersalivation, sweating and agitation
            followed by spastic paralysis of the anterior and posterior
            extremities and death at dose levels of 0.79 mg/mouse
            (PubMed:1397265, PubMed:16278100). It is insecticidal to the larval
            and adult forms of the house fly (PubMed:1397265). The toxin also
            improves cavernosal relaxation in different models where erectile
            dysfonction is observed, such as deoxycorticosterone-acetate
            (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats, mice models for type-1 diabetes, as

            [PHARMACEUTICAL] PnPP-19, a 19 AA-peptide that is N-terminally
            acetylated and C-terminally amidated, has been suggested to be a
            promising drug candidate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction
            (PubMed:26119670). The peptide potentiates erection through an
            increase in nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP production (PubMed:26119670). It
            has no apparent toxicity (when tested on brain, heart, lung, liver
            and kidney) and low immunogenicity in mice (PubMed:26119670). It
            acts by a different mechanism than the native toxin, since it does
            not affect sodium channels, has no effect on the rat heart, and is
            independent of extracellular calcium influx through N-type calcium
            channels (PubMed:26119670). In addition, it has a long half-life

            as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton
            sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent
            proton sensitivity for inactivation (PubMed:23034652). It binds
            more tightly to the closed state and to a much lesser extent the
            inactivated/desensitized state of ASIC1a isoform of ASIC1
            (PubMed:23034652). It interacts directly with the outside surface
            of the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1a (ASIC1a), but does not insert
            into the acidic pocket as suggested for mambalgin-2
            (PubMed:29872539). This binding leads to relocation of the thumb
            domain that could disrupt the acidic pocket of cASIC1a
            (PubMed:29872539). It reversibly inhibits rat ASIC1a (IC(50)=3.4-55
            nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC2b (IC(50)=61 nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC1b (IC(50)=72
            nM), human ASIC1a (IC(50)=127-580 nM), chicken ASIC1a (IC(50)=123.6

            analgesic effect against acute and inflammatory pain upon central
            and peripheral injection (PubMed:23034652). In addition, it also

            disulfide pairing 1-4, 2-5 and 3-6) reversibly inhibits human
            alpha-7/CHRNA7 acetylcholine receptor (IC(50)=880 nM)
            (PubMed:35255330). Shows a paralytic effect in fish (By
            similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P0DKQ2,

            {ECO:0000305|PubMed:24080356}.
            [DOMAIN] The cysteine framework is III (CC-C-C-CC). Classified in
            the M-1 branch, since 1 residue stands between the fourth and the
            fifth cysteine residues. {ECO:0000305}.
            [PTM] Three disulfide isomers have been synthesized and tested.
            SIIID with the disulfide pairing 1-4;2-5;3-6 is the most active.
            {ECO:0000269|PubMed:35255330}.
            [MISCELLANEOUS] Negative results: SIIID with the disulfide pairing
            1-4;2-5;3-6 shows no or very activity on sodium, potassium and
            calcium currents in rat DRG neurons. It does not show obvious
            effect on the human alpha-3-beta 4/CHRNA3-CHRNB4 nicotinic
            acetylcholine receptor. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:35255330}.

            [CAUTION] Wang et al (2022) synthesized and tested activity on the
            short peptide 54-74. By comparison with Conotoxins SIIIA and SIIIB
            (AC P0DKQ2, and AC P0CE77) and according to pair of basic residues,
            the natural peptide may be 2 residues longer at the N-terminus
            (52-74), and may contain a pyrrolidone carboxylic acid at its

            (DmNav1), and arachnid sodium channel V.destructor (VdNav1)
            (PubMed:29567943, PubMed:34445875). Also delays the inactivation of
            most mammalian Nav channels tested (hNav1.1/SCN1A; EC(50)=124.1 nM,

            inhibits the inactivation, resulting in sustained non-inactivating
            currents (PubMed:29567943). In addition, the toxin significantly
            enhances the recovery from inactivation, and the open state is not
            required for the toxin to interact with the channel
            (PubMed:29567943). In vivo, injection into green crabs (Carcinus
            maenas at 1 mug/kg) of small doses (1-5 ug/kg) results in slow and
            fast permanent paralysis, whereas injection of high doses (more
            than 10 ug/kg) causes death (PubMed:29567943). Injection into
            juvenile Blaptica dubia cockroaches results in death or permanent
            paralysis at doses higher than 7.1 ug/kg (PubMed:29567943).
            Injection into brine shrimp (Artemia salina) stops movement or

            as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton
            sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent
            proton sensitivity for inactivation (PubMed:24695733). It binds
            more tightly to the closed state and to a much lesser extent the
            inactivated/desensitized state of ASIC1a isoform of ASIC1
            (PubMed:24695733). It interacts directly with the outside surface
            of the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1a (ASIC1a), but does not insert
            into the acidic pocket as suggested previously (By similarity).
            This binding leads to relocation of the thumb domain that could
            disrupt the acidic pocket of cASIC1a (By similarity). The peptide
            exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on ASIC1a
            (PubMed:24695733). It reversibly inhibits rat ASIC1a (IC(50)=21-55
            nM), rat ASIC1b (IC(50)=103-192 nM), rat ASIC1a-ASIC1b (IC(50)=72

            PubMed:24695733, PubMed:26991634). In vivo, it shows a potent
            naloxone-resistant analgesic effect against acute and inflammatory
            pain upon central and peripheral injection (By similarity). In
            addition, it also has an opioid-independent effect on both thermal
            and mechanical inflammatory pain after systemic administration and
            is effective against neuropathic pain (By similarity).

            [FUNCTION] Delta-conotoxins bind to site 6 of voltage-gated sodium
            channels (Nav) and inhibit the inactivation process. Binding of
            this toxin is strongly calcium-dependent but not voltage-dependent.
            The binding site is most likely on the extracellular side of the
            sodium channel. Binds receptor sites on both mollusk and rat
            central nervous system, but despite its high affinity binding to
            rat sodium channel, it has no functional effect in vivo and in
            vitro on it. Has also no effect on Gambusia fish. Is important in
            mollusk for the paralysis of the prey. Upon injection of the

            [FUNCTION] Component of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein
            complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. The
            small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and
            translates the encoded message by selecting cognate
            aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU)
            contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl
            transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide
            bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into
            a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome
            through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that
            function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane
            insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel.
            {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22096102}.
            [SUBUNIT] Component of the large ribosomal subunit (LSU). Mature
            yeast ribosomes consist of a small (40S) and a large (60S) subunit.
            The 40S small subunit contains 1 molecule of ribosomal RNA (18S
            rRNA) and 33 different proteins (encoded by 57 genes). The large
            60S subunit contains 3 rRNA molecules (25S, 5.8S and 5S rRNA) and
            46 different proteins (encoded by 81 genes) (PubMed:9559554,
            PubMed:22096102). uL5 forms a heterotrimeric complex with uL18/RPL5

            [FUNCTION] Multifunctional protein with controversial molecular
            function which plays an important role in cell protection against
            oxidative stress and cell death acting as oxidative stress sensor
            and redox-sensitive chaperone and protease (PubMed:15784737,
            PubMed:17015834, PubMed:20800516, PubMed:21068725). It is involved
            in neuroprotective mechanisms like the stabilization of NFE2L2 and
            PINK1 proteins, male fertility as a positive regulator of androgen
            signaling pathway as well as cell growth and transformation
            through, for instance, the modulation of NF-kappa-B signaling
            pathway (PubMed:17015834, PubMed:21097510). Has been described as a
            protein and nucleotide deglycase that catalyzes the deglycation of
            the Maillard adducts formed between amino groups of proteins or
            nucleotides and reactive carbonyl groups of glyoxals. But this
            function is rebuted by other works. As a protein deglycase, repairs
            methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired
            proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates
            cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus
            reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Acts
            on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and
            aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of advanced glycation
            endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage. Also functions as
            a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free
            nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus
            involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine
            glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal
            and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic
            acid repair. Protects histones from adduction by methylglyoxal,
            controls the levels of methylglyoxal-derived argininine
            modifications on chromatin. Able to remove the glycations and
            restore histone 3, histone glycation disrupts both local and global
            chromatin architecture by altering histone-DNA interactions as well
            as histone acetylation and ubiquitination levels. Displays a very
            low glyoxalase activity that may reflect its deglycase activity
            (PubMed:22523093). Eliminates hydrogen peroxide and protects cells
            against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (PubMed:17766438).
            Required for correct mitochondrial morphology and function as well
            as for autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria (PubMed:20186336).
            Plays a role in regulating expression or stability of the
            mitochondrial uncoupling proteins SLC25A14 and SLC25A27 in
            dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and
            attenuates the oxidative stress induced by calcium entry into the
            neurons via L-type channels during pacemaking (PubMed:21068725).
            Regulates astrocyte inflammatory responses, may modulate lipid
            rafts-dependent endocytosis in astrocytes and neuronal cells
            (PubMed:23847046, PubMed:19276172). In pancreatic islets, involved
            in the maintenance of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
            levels and glucose homeostasis in an age- and diet dependent
            manner. Protects pancreatic beta cells from cell death induced by
            inflammatory and cytotoxic setting (PubMed:26422139). Binds to a
            number of mRNAs containing multiple copies of GG or CC motifs and
            partially inhibits their translation but dissociates following
            oxidative stress (By similarity). Metal-binding protein able to
            bind copper as well as toxic mercury ions, enhances the cell
            protection mechanism against induced metal toxicity
            (PubMed:23792957). In macrophages, interacts with the NADPH oxidase
            subunit NCF1 to direct NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, and
            protects against sepsis (PubMed:26021615).

            [FUNCTION] Reversible inhibitor of voltage-gated sodium channels
            (Nav). Delays the fast inactivation kinetics of neuronal-type
            sodium channels. In vivo, it induces rat penile erection
            (PubMed:15246765). This effect may be due to the neuronal nitric
            oxide synthase (NOS1), since one of its selective inhibitor
            completely abolishes all the toxic effects of the toxin
            (PubMed:15246765). This toxin also causes scratching, lacrimation,
            hypersalivation, sweating and agitation followed by spastic
            paralysis of the anterior and posterior extremities and death at
            dose levels of 0.24 mg/mouse (PubMed:1397265, PubMed:16278100,

            [DISEASE] Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1 (ALS1) [MIM:105400]: A
            neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons in the
            brain and lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord,
            resulting in fatal paralysis. Sensory abnormalities are absent. The
            pathologic hallmarks of the disease include pallor of the
            corticospinal tract due to loss of motor neurons, presence of
            ubiquitin-positive inclusions within surviving motor neurons, and
            deposition of pathologic aggregates. The etiology of amyotrophic
            lateral sclerosis is likely to be multifactorial, involving both
            genetic and environmental factors. The disease is inherited in
            5-10% of the cases. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10400992,

            (PubMed:23356888, PubMed:24749540). The activity on sodium channels
            consists of inhibition on sodium current inactivation with no
            significant effect on current activation. This effect may be caused
            by direct interaction of the toxin with sodium channel site-3
            (PubMed:23356888, PubMed:24749540). The activity on potassium
            channels consists of a significant increase of the amplitude of the
            transient component of the potassium current, shifting the current
            threshold to more negative membrane potentials. These effects are
            concentration-dependent and reversible and may be due to a direct
            interaction between the toxin and the voltage-sensing domain of the
            channel (PubMed:24749540). Physiologically, this toxin increases
            the amplitude of cardiomyocyte contraction and slows the late phase
            of the twitch relaxation velocity with no induction of spontaneous
            twitching. It increases action potential duration of cardiomyocytes
            with no effect on its threshold and on the cell resting potential.
            On insects, it shows neurotoxic activity to the blowfly larvae
