            [FUNCTION] The recombinant mu-cyrtautoxin-As1a potently and
            voltage-independently blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) of
            insects. It acts by pluging the outer vestibule of the channel. It
            acts in combination with a weak (30%) voltage-independent block of
            insect voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels (low-voltage and
            high-voltage channels). Tested on DUM neurons, it inhibits sodium
            currents with an IC(50) of 540 nM (and a Hill coefficient >1,
            reflecting an incomplete block at higher concentrations). In vivo,
            it induces flaccid paralysis in adult Australian sheep blowfly
            Lucilia cuprina (PubMed:23473802). It is both paralytic and lethal,
            when injected into lepidopteran larvae. It is a slower acting
            toxin, being lethal at 24 hours, but not paralytic at 1 hour

            (PubMed:34302796). It is insecticidal, since it induces reversible
            paralysis in insects (L.cuprina) after 1 hour, but fails to kill
            flies (PubMed:34302796). It shows a relatively strong and
            broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive
            and Gram-negative bacteria (MIC<20 uM) (PubMed:34302796). It is
            also anthelmintic, since it potently inhibits the larval
            development of the major pathogenic nematode of ruminants
            (H.contortus, IC(50)=2.8 uM) (PubMed:34302796). Interestingly, only
            at 10 uM, it increases adult males motility of the other nematode
            B.malayi for 24 hours post-treatment, followed by a reduction in
            motility for the rest of the experiment (PubMed:34302796). It shows
            cytotoxic activity against HEK293 cells (EC(50)=4-6 uM) and induces
            hemolysis in human erythrocytes (EC(50)=40-62 uM)

            lines, which supports a non-specific membrane perturbation
            mechanism of action (PubMed:34302796). In vivo, it induces pain by

            [FUNCTION] Toxin that is known to potentiate erectile function
            (PubMed:18397797). It binds voltage-dependently to sodium channels
            (Nav), inhibits the inactivation of the activated channels and
            decreases the peak inward current (PubMed:19231838,
            PubMed:26119670). The toxin delays inactivation of Nav1.2/SCN2A,
            Nav1.3/SCN3A, Nav1.4/SCN4A and Nav1.8/SCN10A, slows the
            inactivation process and decreases the sodium peak amplitude of
            Nav1.5/SCN5A and Nav1.6/SCN8A (PubMed:26119670). In vivo, it
            enhances erectile function by inducing the release of nictric oxide
            (NO): it slows the sodium current, leading to depolarization, which
            leads to an increase in calcium influx (probably via activation of
            N-type calcium channels) which in turn activates neuronal NO
            synthase (nNOS/NOS1), inducing nitric oxide (NO) production
            (PubMed:20722794, PubMed:21975567). In a final step, NO activates
            soluble guanylate cyclase (GUCY1A1/GUCY1B1) which in turn increases
            cGMP formation, resulting in penile erection (PubMed:23583324). It
            is noteworthy that the toxin does not provoke erection by
            inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5A), an enzyme that
            hydrolysis cGMP (PubMed:23583324). In vivo, it also causes
            scratching, lacrimation, hypersalivation, sweating and agitation
            followed by spastic paralysis of the anterior and posterior
            extremities and death at dose levels of 0.79 mg/mouse
            (PubMed:1397265, PubMed:16278100). It is insecticidal to the larval
            and adult forms of the house fly (PubMed:1397265). The toxin also
            improves cavernosal relaxation in different models where erectile
            dysfonction is observed, such as deoxycorticosterone-acetate
            (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats, mice models for type-1 diabetes, as
            well as elderly rats (PubMed:18397797, PubMed:21975567,

            not affect sodium channels, has no effect on the rat heart, and is
            independent of extracellular calcium influx through N-type calcium
            channels (PubMed:26119670). In addition, it has a long half-life

            (PubMed:34302796). It is insecticidal, since it induces contractile
            paralysis in insects (L.cuprina) during several hours and death
            after 24 hours (PubMed:34302796). It shows a relatively strong and
            broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive
            and Gram-negative bacteria (MIC<20 uM) (PubMed:34302796). It is
            also antiparasitic, since it potently inhibits the larval
            development of the major pathogenic nematode of ruminants
            (H.contortus, IC(50)=5.6 uM) and reduces the motility of adult
            males of the other nematode B.malayi (PubMed:34302796). It also
            shows cytotoxic activity against HEK293 cells (EC(50)=5-7 uM) but
            does not induce hemolysis in human erythrocytes (PubMed:34302796).
            In addition, it causes a moderate increase in intracellular calcium
            concentration on neuronal and epithelial cell lines, which supports
            a non-specific membrane perturbation mechanism of action
            (PubMed:34302796). In vivo, it induces pain by intraplantar
            injection into mice, suggesting a defensive function against
            vertebrate predators (PubMed:34302796).

            [FUNCTION] This insecticidal neurotoxin targets two types of
            channels/receptors. It reversibly inhibits the N-methyl-D-aspartate
            (NMDA)-subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIN)
            (PubMed:10978749). It inhibits glutamate uptake from rat brain
            synaptosomes, and blocks GRIN in hippocampal slices
            (PubMed:10978749, PubMed:26802625). It also acts on sodium channels
            of both insects and mammals (PubMed:26747232). On sodium channel
            insects, it strongly slows down channel inactivation (EC(50)=212.5
            nM) and causes an increase (105%) in peak amplitude (at 1 uM) of
            B.germanica sodium channel (Nav), whereas it inhibits all mammalien
            sodium channels tested with the following order of potency:
            Nav1.3/SCN3A (IC(50)=1.5 uM) > Nav1.6/SCN8A > Nav1.5/SCN5A >
            Nav1.4/SCN4A >= Nav1.2/SCN2A (PubMed:26747232). In vivo, it is
            highly toxic to house fly (Musca domestica), cockroach (Periplaneta
            americana), and cricket (Acheta domesticus) (PubMed:10978749). In
            different rat pain models (induced by PGE2, carrageenan or
            glutamate), it shows antinociceptive effect that may be related to
            an inhibitory activity on the glutamatergic system

  TITLE     delta-Ctenitoxin-Pn1a, a Peptide from Phoneutria nigriventer Spider
            Venom, Shows Antinociceptive Effect Involving Opioid and
            Cannabinoid Systems, in Rats","On May 11, 2004 this sequence version replaced gi:29840815.
            [FUNCTION] This neurotoxin binds at site 3 of insect
            voltage-activated sodium channels (Nav) and prolongs evoked axonal
            action potentials by a slowing down of sodium current inactivation
            (PubMed:12770132). The toxin also inhibits glutamate uptake from
            rat brain synaptosomes (PubMed:14757211). It reversibly inhibits
            the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-subtype of ionotropic glutamate
            receptor (GRIN) (By similarity). In addition, the toxin shows
            antinociceptive effect in all rat pain models tested (inflammatory,
            neuropathic and nociceptive) (PubMed:27077886). The antinociceptive
            effect is partially blocked when selective antagonists of both mu-
            and delta-opioid receptors are administered, revealing that the
            antinociceptive effect of the toxin involves both opioid and
            cannabinoid endogenous systems (PubMed:27077886). In vivo, it is
            highly toxic to house fly (Musca domestica), toxic to cockroach,
            but has no effect when intracerebroventricularly injected into mice
            (PubMed:7778132, PubMed:12770132). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P59367,
